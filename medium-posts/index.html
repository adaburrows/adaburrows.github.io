Many people, including actors from Star Trek, have raised issues with how similar it looks to the Starfleet Command logo. It turns out it’s no accident that this has happened, but not for the reasons you probably think. When Star Trek came on the air in the 60s, there was already a long legacy of the Air Force using similar logos and seals going back to at least 1935. Star Trek has borrowed from real life on numerous occasions, from riffing off the UN for the United Federation of planets in Star Trek The Motion Picture from 1979 to the mirror universe Terran Empire emblem.</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/star-trek-or-us-space-force-251a7494ad5f><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/coronavirus-sars-cov-2-dissecting-the-virus-2ccc5499cf73>Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Dissecting the virus</a></h2><div class=post-meta><h4>Fri, Apr 10, 2020</h4></div></header><p>An updated scientific and clinical overview.</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/coronavirus-sars-cov-2-dissecting-the-virus-2ccc5499cf73><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/coronavirus-sars-cov2-03-17-2020-4994b1f86b8c>Coronavirus SARS-CoV2: 03/17/2020</a></h2><div class=post-meta><h4>Tue, Mar 17, 2020</h4></div></header><p>COVID-19 symptoms can be distinguished from flu symptoms by one main factor: It does not cause a runny nose. That being said, one can still have a runny nose if one is infected with multiple viruses (Wu et al.). The other give away is developing a dry cough. The other symptoms in order of severity are: Fever, Dry Cough, Fatigue, Sputum production (that’s thick mucus in the lungs), Shortness of breath, Muscle pain/joint pain, Sore Throat, Headache, Chills. Less common symptoms are: Nausea/vomiting, Nasal congestion, Diarrhea. Symptoms typically start with fever then progress to a dry cough.</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/coronavirus-sars-cov2-03-17-2020-4994b1f86b8c><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/our-broken-realities-d75c90e4f8b2>Our Broken Realities</a></h2><div class=post-meta><h4>Mon, Feb 10, 2020</h4></div></header><p>Can we mend our splintered reality?</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/our-broken-realities-d75c90e4f8b2><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/a-history-of-amazon-deforestation-383e81b7b9d5>A History of Amazon Deforestation</a></h2><div class=post-meta><h4>Thu, Nov 14, 2019</h4></div></header><p>The problem with Brazil doing any settler-colonizer style agriculture is they have just the smallest bit of suitable land. They have just the smallest bit of natural prairie at the south side of the country. It’s only in the State of Rio Grande do Sol. That same prairie bioregion extends down into Uruguay and Buenos Aires, but it’s absolutely tiny in Brazil (Overbeck et al., 2008). So what’s Brazil to do? The grileiros (from grilos, locusts) come to plague the land. They tear down existing biospheres. They steal land and kill Indigenous people.

However, their reach doesn’t stop there. Every time you visit a web page which uses an advertising platform as a partner (which might include Twitter, Facebook, or a number of others), those companies are informed of exactly which pages you visited on the Internet. They know which blogs you frequent, what news articles you read, and the items you might have considered buying. They may even know what sex toys you’ve been thinking of buying from the supposed comfort and privacy of your own bed.</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/help-im-being-stalked-by-robots-aae5a1c40d12><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><a href=https://medium.com/jill-burrows/martin-luther-king-jr-stares-towards-the-16th-street-baptist-church-ed95aaf25d21>Martin Luther King Jr. Stares Towards the 16th Street Baptist Church</a></h2><div class=post-meta><h4>Tue, Jan 22, 2019</h4></div></header><p>I met MLKJ’s statue in Birmingham, AL.
