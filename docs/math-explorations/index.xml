I was also told that multiplication was repeated addition. I took this at face value and I though that this was how computers calculated things. It made sense for integers. It made sense that one could cheat repeated addition for powers of two by bit shifting and not repeated addition on platforms that only have addition, but not multiplication.</description></item></channel></rss>
