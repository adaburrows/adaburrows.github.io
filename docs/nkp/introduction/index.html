It will likely become a book at some point.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=what-is-programming-about>What is Programming About?</h2><p>Originally, computers were people hired by the government or other large business. They would do large numbers of potentially complicated computations by hand and file the results back and forth. &ldquo;Programming&rdquo; back then was figuring out how all of the work for a computation should be doled out to individuals or groups and how results from one group should be given to another group for further computation. Programming is mostly an operations problem involving the management of dependencies between parts of the problems and the communication of the results to other parts of the computation.</p><p>As technology evolved, there were several factors which converged to create computing as it is today. Logicians and mathematicians did a lot of leg work to develop the core concepts of representing ideas as numbers. People working in business communications wanted to make a lot of their work more efficient, so they developed techniques to use technology to transfer information quickly. People were attempting to sove large problems which couldn&rsquo;t be solved by people within the time constraints allowed by war. This lead to a lot of developments which all converged under the pressure of war to create computers. Once the transistor was made and integrated circuits were perfected, the cost of computing went down drastically. This got businesses hooked because it became cheaper to do the same amount of computation. The cost was reduced because fewer people (remember the &ldquo;computers&rdquo; of the past?) needed to be employed and fewer tools needed to be purchased (although semiconductor companies were quite fond of pushing new tools every two years), additionally the cost of the computers went down because they where manufactured at scale.</p><p>This means we can disect programming and computing into three main dimensions:</p><ul><li>Arithmetic</li><li>Logic</li><li>Communication</li></ul><p>Even today, one of the largest applications of computing is Facebook. Facebook is quite simply a Sumerian pipe dream of recording and accounting as much as possible about our lives and intereactions with businesses. Facebook tabulates each of the likes (and recently, other reactions, &ldquo;love&rdquo;, &ldquo;care&rdquo;, &ldquo;haha&rdquo;, &ldquo;wow&rdquo;, &ldquo;sad&rdquo;, and &ldquo;angry&rdquo;) on posts and comments, building up a complete accounting of interactions on their platform. Despite thinking of Facebook as a communication platform, they are really an accounting platform. This of course, fits in perfectly with the business side of the application, which is advertising.</p><p>Many of the games we&rsquo;ve played through the ages are based on a type of rule based accounting. Eliminate peices off a board by moving in certain ways (Chess and Checkers). Lay down a certain pattern of cards, which according to the rules, tabulate to a higher score (card games). Roll a higher number with the dice (most games of chance). Form the longest words with rare letters to get the highest score (Scrabble). Form the largest patches of area using black or white stones, with a lot of other rules dictating the protocol of the game (Go). Even if we were come up with an emotional game, we would probably adapt the rules of golf to minimize the number of negative reactions one garners before making everyone happy (I suppose we could count comedy as this game).</p><p>Many of the things we care about in our many cultures are all based on some form of math and logical thinking. In the games laid out above, we can see the three main areas of arithmetic, logic, and communication embodied. In a card game one has to add up the values of the cards, logically ensure they&rsquo;ve followed the rules (and perhaps deduce the likelihood of other people having certain cards), and the communication is embedded in the visibility of the cards and people&rsquo;s facial expressions. Even in cooking we use a rough arithmetic of proportions, a logic of how and when the ingredients are added together, and communication of how to propagate the knowledge of those foods. The same could be said for music, weaving, and many other things.</p><p>To reiterate, programming is the art and science of managing the transfer of information over a vastly complex communications network between the peripherals, many forms of memory, and processing centers within each processor. Most data centers and large distributed systems have the complexity of galaxies of communications systems all tied together and multiple worlds of processors all tied together. Now days, with all the web applications we have, the complexity of the communications between the various components of the distributed system has become even more complex. In some ways, it&rsquo;s a wonder we&rsquo;ve even bothered building the complex behemoths we&rsquo;ve built. In other ways, it&rsquo;s the obvious outcome of a culture bent on the &ldquo;scientific management&rdquo; method of maximizing profit and poductivity while minimizing cost through planning, scheduling, and standardization.</p><h2 id=the-four-bases-of-computing>The Four Bases of Computing</h2><p>The necessary developments which lead to computers and programming mostly fell along four divisions:</p><ul><li>Business and Military Management</li><li>Mathematics</li><li>Communications</li><li>Engineering</li></ul><h3 id=business-and-military-management-basis>Business and Military Management Basis</h3><p>We started counting and started realizing the benefit of keeping symbols around as a proxy for the counted. Then we started managing the way things were built. Then we started managing how people worked. As a result of the pressures and converging technologies programming became the art of managing the computers. Nowdays, we even have arbitrary levels of managers to manage the computer managers (programmers).</p><ul><li><em>5000 BCE</em> — Sumerians start recording inventories, loans, taxes, business transactions, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-nasir>even complaints</a>.

This is most definitely not the first dicussion of division of labor, as it has been discussed in multiple locales since at least 1100 BC. This kind of thinking of single purpose laborers leads to thoughts about floor plan optimization, communication between distant parts of a business, and the shape of the human &ldquo;computers&rdquo; and their work follows from this thought. Even the layout of modern processors also follows from this thought.</li><li><em>1795</em> — <a href=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Terry-3725>Eli Terry Sr.</a>, my 3rd cousin 5x removed, <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Terry>invents a milling machine and begins making interchangeable parts for clocks</a> along with an assembly line.

His definition was &ldquo;&mldr; the art of well-ordering the functionings of an army, of well combining the order of troops in columns, the times of their departure, their itinerary, the means of communication necessary to assure their arrival at a named point &mldr;".</li><li><em>1869</em> — U.S. Intercontinental Railroad completed.</li><li><em>1883</em> — Standard time zones are adopted by the railroads in order to synchronize schedules.</li><li><em>1904</em> — Harrington Emerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;betterment work&rdquo; begins at Santa Fe Railway. Bonuses were introduced as positive feedback for good performance. Time studies were and an effort was made to ensure normal people would be used as to not set too high a bar for performance. Tools were standardized so that anyone could pick up a task and have the right tools. Improved methods of cost accounting were introduced. All work and tasks were assigned through a central board that displayed the status and assignments for everyone and everything.</li><li><em>1910-1915</em> — Henry Gantt invents the Gantt Chart.

Alford starts pushing systematic management. Later he works with Alexander Hamilton Church and some of there ideas were extensions of Charles Babbage&rsquo;s thought.</li><li><em>1924</em> — Walter A. Shrewhart at Bell Labs invents the control chart. That same year or the next, W.

At the core of programming today&rsquo;s technological marvels is the concept of a symbol standing in for another symbol. Gödel, Church, Turing, and Hopper all pushed this a level further each. Gödel came up with a system of encoding logic using arithmetic and later a general system of recursive functions. Church built upon this creating a lambda calculus of computation. Turing built upon it creating a non-physical mechanical system that encoded logic and values in an infinite memory. Hopper realized that this could be extended to create a higher level language of certain values encoding for other values specific to the machine they were meant to operate on. This same principle became extended more and more until we could use math to display video mapped on a Cartesian coordinate system which was then mapped again back into a linear address space and extended until we could encode audio as binary digits. Then, in the 1980s, we discovered methods of compression which were necessary to make multimedia computing and the Internet work gicen the limited resources we had attained at the time.</p><ul><li><em>2700-2300 BCE</em> — Sumerian abacus. They used a base 60 number system.</li><li><em>2000</em> — Babylonians and Egyptians have theorems about the sides of triangles (trigonometry).</li><li><em>300 BCE</em> — Babylonians use one of their punctuation symbols as a zero-like placeholder.</li><li><em>200-100 BCE</em> — Brahmi numerals are invented, becoming the basis of Indian and Hindu-Arabic numerals — they do not include zero. Pingala uses a concept of void, <em>śūnya</em>, in his writings on prosody as a placeholder for zero essentially creating a big-endian binary system. Zero as a plaeholder isn&rsquo;t repeated until the <em>Lokavibhāga</em> in 458 CE. This same century, Hipparchus is using a placeholder for zero and making tables of chords, which actually means bowstring in the Greek, and these are the precursors to trigonometric functions.</li><li><em>40 BCE</em> — Andronicus of Rhodes compiles Aristotle&rsquo;s works on logic into six volumes of the <em>Organon</em>. Interestingly, Aristotle would call logic &ldquo;analytics&rdquo;.</li><li><em>36 BCE</em> — Maya-Lenca associated civilizations already have zero as part of the long count calendar. They used a base 20 number system, and a few remaining cultures still use it. The concept spreads through the adjacent regions, but as far as we know it never spreads beyond the so-called &ldquo;Americas&rdquo;. The Tawantinsuyu (Inca) had an encoding for zero in their khipu by there being a missing knot in the corresponding position. It would be amazing to see what kinds of computation could have evolved out of this system, but it was cut short by colonization. Perhaps one day Indigenous people will continue developing our indigenous systems. They also had various mechanisms for calculation, see: <a href=https://ig.ft.com/special-reports/maya-maths/>Maya number system</a>, <a href=http://www.quipus.it/english/Andean%20Calculators.pdf>Yupana</a>, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus#Native_American>Nepōhualtzintzin</a>.</li><li><em>200</em> — Diophantus of Alexandria.</li><li><em>350-505</em> — <em>Surya Siddhanta</em> using similar methods to Hipparchus, the math of the heavens (jyotisha) are laid out in terms of the jya (bow-string).</li><li><em>499</em> — <em>Aryabhatiya</em> introduces sine, cos, and inverse sine (jya, koti-jya, utkrama-jya) as half angle half chord versions of those found in <em>Surya Siddhanta</em>.</li><li><em>~800</em> — Virasena calculate base 2,3, & 4 logarithms.</li><li><em>820</em> — Al-Khwārizmī writes <em>Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wal-muqābala</em>, or <em>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</em>.</li><li><em>1126</em> — Adelard of Bath translates Al-Khwārizmī&rsquo;s works on Indian numbers as <em>Dixit Algorizmi</em>.</li><li><em>1145</em> — Robert of Chester translates Al-Khwārizmī&rsquo;s book of &ldquo;algebra&rdquo; into Latin as <em>Liber algebrae et almucabala</em>.</li><li><em>1150</em> — Bhāskara II writes the Siddhānta Śiromani which lays out methods of trigonometry and calculus, but predated Newton and Leibniz.</li><li><em>1202</em> — Leonardo Fibonacci publishes <em>Liber Abaci</em>.

One had to:</p><ul><li>Be intimately familiar with the hardware being used.</li><li>Analyze the scope of the computation.</li><li>Divide the computation into stages which can be performed on the hardware.</li><li>Plant out the logic and arithmetic of each task and how memory would be utilized.</li><li>Translate that logic, arithmetic, and storage instructions into machine code.</li><li>Input that code into the machine using an interface specific to each machine (wires, switches, punch cards, etc.).</li><li>Read out and record the output of the computation.</li></ul><p>Later, assemblers were invented that let people use architecture specific mnemonics called assembly language instead of binary, octal, or hexadecimal. In time, people like Grace Hopper came along and — in addition to removing physical bugs from the hardware — they created higher level languages. These were unique in several ways. One, they didn&rsquo;t require complete knowledge of the hardware. Two, while they still required some memory management, they could plan out memory address offsets and register usage automatically. Three, you could write a program on one machine architecture and it was likely that if the language became avalable on another machine architecture, it would still compile.</p><p>The next big evolution in programming was dynamic memory management. This meant programmer no longer had to specifically plan out memory usage (in theory), but the language itself would plan out how and when to allocate and release memory. There was typically a reference counter for variables and when the reference count reached zero the memory would be released. This evolved into more advanced forms of garbage collection. Unfortunately, there were some unfortunate side effects. Sometimes people could write code which cause a rerference to stick around beyond its actual use, this lead to memory leaks. Also, in certain cases the garbage collector would cause some pretty awful hickups when it decided it was time to clean up during a critical moment. There are work-arounds, but they typically mean hacking the language into letting one plan out memory allocation manually.</p><p>There are a lot of patterns which have emerged over the decades, and there are many books written about them. A modicum of the patterns have libraries or frameworks which support them. Many of them don&rsquo;t, which means that programmers must build their own libraries or frameworks for many patterns.</p><p>By default, many programming laguages support a text based environment because of the historical backwards compatiblility of only having a text based interface. When programs entered the world of visual interfaces there where several ways that interfaces could be built. Many games opted for implementing their own graphics engine which wrote directly to the video buffer (or virtual buffer, which was copied synced to the refresh rate to minimize visual artifacts). Programs for operating systems like OS/2, Windows, and other interfaces would use a kind of object oriented approach that would work even if the laguage wasn&rsquo;t object oriented.</p><p>Every visual element on the screen would have multiple objects associated with them. Many properties had to be filled in programmatically in an imperative style. Messages would be dispatched to worker threads through a central dispatcher (a WindowProc in Windows). Absolutely everything about the user interface had to laid out programmatically. If you wanted a particular layout that would resize as the window changed, you needed to write the code yourself. This started changing when Sun Microsystems released Java with its Abstract Windowing Toolkit and became easier with Swing. Along with those layout engines, the standards starting to brew around HTML + CSS started to make declarative UIs very appealing.</p><h2 id=programming-is-stuck>Programming is Stuck</h2><p>Fundamentally, nothing about programming interfaces has changed since 1997. Data exchange (or data binding, if you prefer) remains an issue; though it seems like a few patterns are being settled on. Organizing code around UI and UX is still an issue. Making sure code is organized around various independent orthogonal issues seems to be a challenge. Most languages still place the burden on the programmer to manage where data is and how it is transfered around the system. Things like GraphQL have made many of these issues easier to solve. However, we still keep repeating ourselves over and over and reinventing the same wheel someone else invented in the 70s. Sometimes we get actual progress.</p><p>We have an acronym for to remind us not to do this: DRY, Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself. It is the maxim most programmers live by. It is why we build standard libraries, garbage collectors, frameworks, reusable bits of code, isomorphic coding, and many other things. However, there are certain things that always seem to need to be repeated with a few changes each time we add a new screen of form to an application.</p><figure><img src=//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ineffective_sorts.png><figcaption><h4>XKCD: "StackSort connects to StackOverflow, searches for 'sort a list', and downloads and runs code snippets until the list is sorted."</h4></figcaption></figure><hr><p><a href=http://adaburrows.com/docs/nkp/analyze-sota/>Next</a></p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/adaburrows/adaburrows.github.io/commit/9c8a87c3864a1566dd144d33f4c8352e2a9d821b title="Last modified by Jillian Ada Burrows | June 7, 2020" target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
