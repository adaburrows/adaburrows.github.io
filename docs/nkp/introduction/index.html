It will likely become a book at some point.</strong></p><hr><h2 id=what-is-programming-about>What is Programming About?
<a class=anchor href=#what-is-programming-about>#</a></h2><p>Originally, computers were people hired by the government or other large business. They would do large numbers of potentially complicated computations by hand and file the results back and forth. &ldquo;Programming&rdquo; back then was figuring out how all of the work for a computation should be doled out to individuals or groups and how results from one group should be given to another group for further computation. Programming is mostly an operations problem involving the management of dependencies between parts of the problems and the communication of the results to other parts of the computation.</p><p>As technology evolved, there were several factors which converged to create computing as it is today. Logicians and mathematicians did a lot of leg work to develop the core concepts of representing ideas as numbers. People working in business communications wanted to make a lot of their work more efficient, so they developed techniques to use technology to transfer information quickly. People were attempting to solve large problems which couldn&rsquo;t be solved by people within the time constraints allowed by war. This lead to a lot of developments which all converged under the pressure of war to create computers. Once the transistor was made and integrated circuits were perfected, the cost of computing went down drastically. Large businesses became locked into using computers because of the reduced cost. The cost was reduced because the computations could be done faster and fewer people (remember the &ldquo;computers&rdquo; of the past?) needed to be employed. Additionally, fewer tools needed to be purchased (although semiconductor companies were quite fond of pushing new tools every two years). As computers were mass produced and adopted at scale, the cost of the computers went down. Today, it is very difficult to find electronic devices which do not have at least a microcontroller in their circuits.</p><h3 id=three-dimensions-of-computation>Three Dimensions of Computation
<a class=anchor href=#three-dimensions-of-computation>#</a></h3><p>This means we can dissect programming and computing into three main dimensions:</p><ul><li>Arithmetic</li><li>Logic</li><li>Communication</li></ul><p>These three dimensions have been used since the time of Sumeria, where they quite litterally tabulated information about business into clay tablets. They accounted for much of their government and business transactions. Today, the largest application of computing is still accounting. Most computers sit around doing nothing besides adding transactions, points, views, clicks, and coordinates.</p><p>Despite thinking of Facebook as a communication platform, they are really an accounting and advertising platform. Facebook is quite simply a Sumerian pipe dream of recording and accounting as much as possible about our lives and interactions with businesses. Facebook tabulates each of the likes (and recently, other reactions, &ldquo;love&rdquo;, &ldquo;care&rdquo;, &ldquo;haha&rdquo;, &ldquo;wow&rdquo;, &ldquo;sad&rdquo;, and &ldquo;angry&rdquo;) on posts and comments, building up a complete accounting of interactions on their platform. These bits are then used to profile you and match you with targeted advertising, then they are also archived and sent into &ldquo;cold storage&rdquo; where the permanance of the bits will never rival those markings on Sumerian clay tablets.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Can you imgaine how awkward Facebook would be if, instead of being a software service, it was an actual Sumerian scribe following you around tabulating every reaction and message? They would have to go through your photo albums and memorize every face and point them out when you came across that person. They would take down messages and send them between you and your friend&rsquo;s Sumerian scribes. They would also use the tabulated results of all you likes, reactions, message sentiments, and location to suggest businesses you might possibly want something from. Think about the cost and the overtime pay because of how often we&rsquo;re on our phones using Facebook!</p><p>Or can you imagine what it would be like to have to hire secretaries for everyone to organize and send messages like Slack or other similar chat applications allow us to do? It would sure make more jobs, but it would also make the service very expensive. This is the power of computers to make things cheaper by automating as much of the accounting as possible.</p><p>On the other hand, what Facebook does is still expensive. It has many costs from the sheer scale it operates at, some of those costs are ecological. For instance, in 2019, <a href=https://sustainability.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2019-Sustainability-Data-Disclosure_Final-1.pdf>Facebook used 5,140,000 MWh of power</a>. This is <a href=https://www.urbangreencouncil.org/sites/default/files/state_of_the_nyc_grid_urban_green_council.pdf>roughly 1/10th of the energy used by NYC in the same year</a>. Additionally, it used used 2,731,000 cubic meter of water to cool down its data centers — this is approximately the same water usage as 1.7 NYC popuplations. Since this water is heated, it may increase the heat in whatever body of water it is released into. This is actually really bad for fish in rivers.</p></blockquote><h3 id=echoes-in-games-and-art>Echoes in Games and Art
<a class=anchor href=#echoes-in-games-and-art>#</a></h3><p>Many of the games we&rsquo;ve played through the ages are based on a type of rule based accounting. Eliminate pieces off a board by moving in certain ways (Chess and Checkers). Lay down a certain pattern of cards, which according to the rules, tabulate to a higher score (card games). Roll a higher number with the dice (most games of chance). Form the longest words with the most infrequent letters to get the highest score (Scrabble). Form the largest patches of area using black or white stones, with a lot of other rules dictating the protocol of the game (Go). Even if we were to come up with games of emotions, we might unconciously adapt the rules of golf to minimize the number of negative reactions one garners before rewarding people with the emotional response they want (we do have these games: comedy, storytelling, music, etc.).</p><p>Many of the things we care about in our many cultures are all based on some form of math and logical thinking. In the games laid out above, we can see the three main areas of arithmetic, logic, and communication embodied. In a card game one has to add up the values of the cards, logically ensure they&rsquo;ve followed the rules, and perhaps deduce the likelihood of other players having certain cards; the communication is embedded in the visibility of the cards and people&rsquo;s facial expressions. In cooking we use a rough arithmetic of proportions, a logic of how and when the ingredients are added together, and communication of how to propagate the knowledge of those foods. The same could be said for music, weaving, and multitudes of other things.</p><h3 id=summary-of-programming>Summary of Programming
<a class=anchor href=#summary-of-programming>#</a></h3><p>To reiterate, programming is the art and science of managing the transfer of information over a vastly complex communications network between the peripherals, many forms of memory, and processing centers within each processor. Most data centers and large distributed systems have the complexity of galaxies of communications systems all tied together; and within those galaxies, multiple worlds of processors are all tied together. With all of today&rsquo;s web applications we have, the complexity of the communications between the various components our distributed systems has become even more complex. In some ways, it&rsquo;s a wonder we&rsquo;ve even bothered building these complex behemoths. In other ways, it&rsquo;s the obvious outcome of a culture bent on the &ldquo;scientific management&rdquo; method of maximizing profit and poductivity while minimizing cost through planning, scheduling, and standardization.</p><h2 id=the-four-necessary-bases-for-the-emergence-of-computers>The Four Necessary Bases for the Emergence of Computers
<a class=anchor href=#the-four-necessary-bases-for-the-emergence-of-computers>#</a></h2><p>The necessary developments which lead to computers and programming mostly fell along four divisions:</p><p><em>Business and Military Management</em></p><p>We started counting and started realizing the benefit of keeping symbols around as a proxy for the counted. Then we started managing the way things were built. Then we started managing how people worked. As a result of the pressures and converging technologies programming became the art of managing the computers. Nowdays, we even have arbitrary levels of managers to manage the computer managers (programmers).</p><p><em>Mathematics</em></p><p>This developed hand in hand with the business and military espects, but is interesting for the independence pure mathmatics obtained. At the core of programming today&rsquo;s technological marvels is the concept of a symbol standing in for another symbol. Gödel, Church, Turing, and Hopper all pushed this a level further each. Gödel came up with a system of encoding logic using arithmetic and later a general system of recursive functions. Church built upon this creating a lambda calculus of computation. Turing built upon it creating a non-physical mechanical system that encoded logic and values in an infinite memory. Hopper realized that this could be extended to create a higher level language of certain values encoding for other values specific to the machine they were meant to operate on. This same principle became extended more and more until we could use math to display video mapped on a Cartesian coordinate system which was then mapped again back into a linear address space. This sort of though was extended until we could encode audio as binary digits. Then, in the 1980s, we discovered methods of compression which were necessary to make multimedia computing and the Internet work gicen the limited resources we had attained at the time.</p><p><em>Communications</em></p><p>The communications basis is separate from the physical basis because it evolved separately, until the concepts were merged together in the 1960s. The communications basis started with the telegraph, then teleprinting, then the telephone. As the telephone developed automatic ways of routing calls, the necessary concepts of digital addressing were developed.</p><p><em>Physical/Engineering</em></p><p>The physical basis of computing is intriguing, because we were building similar, yet limited, physical mechanisms since proabbly around 300BCE. While Babbage had an amazing idea with the analytical engine, the design was never finalized and correspondingly never built. It wasn&rsquo;t until the electromechanical developments of the communications basis that we could transfer information to distances needed to fully implement computers which were powerful enough to be general purpose devices.</p><h3 id=business-and-military-management-basis>Business and Military Management Basis

This is most definitely not the first dicussion of division of labor, as it has been discussed in multiple locales since at least 1100 BC. This kind of thinking of single purpose laborers leads to thoughts about floor plan optimization, communication between distant parts of a business, and the shape of the human &ldquo;computers&rdquo; and their work follows from this thought. Even the layout of modern processors also follows from this thought.</li><li><em>1795</em> — <a href=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Terry-3725>Eli Terry Sr.</a>, my 3rd cousin 5x removed, <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Terry>invents a milling machine and begins making interchangeable parts for clocks</a> along with an assembly line.

As a side note, he was an <a href=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2019/02/20/eli-terry/>anti-slavery abolitionist and his house had a secret room for runaway slaves</a>.</li><li><em>1814</em> — Francis Cabot Lowell created the Boston Manufacturing Company which was the first vertically integrated manufacturing plant taking in raw materials and outputing final products. This became the Lowell System.</li><li><em>1830</em> — Antoine-Henri Jomini coined the French word <em>logistique</em> (rising from the French <em>logis</em> meaning <em>lodgings</em>) in his Précis de l&rsquo;Art de la Guerre (Summary of the Art of War). His definition was &ldquo;&mldr; the art of well-ordering the functionings of an army, of well combining the order of troops in columns, the times of their departure, their itinerary, the means of communication necessary to assure their arrival at a named point &mldr;&rdquo;.</li><li><em>1869</em> — U.S. Intercontinental Railroad completed.</li><li><em>1883</em> — Standard time zones are adopted by the railroads in order to synchronize schedules.</li><li><em>1904</em> — Harrington Emerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;betterment work&rdquo; begins at Santa Fe Railway. Bonuses were introduced as positive feedback for good performance. Time studies were and an effort was made to ensure normal people would be used as to not set too high a bar for performance. Tools were standardized so that anyone could pick up a task and have the right tools. Improved methods of cost accounting were introduced.

Pingala uses a concept of void, <em>śūnya</em>, in his writings on prosody as a placeholder for zero essentially creating a big-endian binary system. Zero as a plaeholder isn&rsquo;t repeated until the <em>Lokavibhāga</em> in 458 CE. This same century, Hipparchus is using a placeholder for zero and making tables of chords, which actually means bowstring in the Greek, and these are the precursors to trigonometric functions.</li><li><em>40 BCE</em> — Andronicus of Rhodes compiles Aristotle&rsquo;s works on logic into six volumes of the <em>Organon</em>. Interestingly, Aristotle would call logic &ldquo;analytics&rdquo;.</li><li><em>36 BCE</em> — Maya-Lenca associated civilizations already have zero as part of the long count calendar. They used a base 20 number system, and a few remaining cultures still use it. The concept spreads through the adjacent regions, but as far as we know it never spreads beyond the so-called &ldquo;Americas&rdquo;. The Tawantinsuyu (Inca) had an encoding for zero in their khipu by there being a missing knot in the corresponding position. It would be amazing to see what kinds of computation could have evolved out of this system, but it was cut short by colonization. Perhaps one day Indigenous people will continue developing our indigenous systems. They also had various mechanisms for calculation, see: <a href=https://ig.ft.com/special-reports/maya-maths/>Maya number system</a>, <a href=http://www.quipus.it/english/Andean%20Calculators.pdf>Yupana</a>, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus#Native_American>Nepōhualtzintzin</a>.</li><li><em>200</em> — Diophantus of Alexandria.</li><li><em>350-505</em> — <em>Surya Siddhanta</em> using similar methods to Hipparchus, the math of the heavens (jyotisha) are laid out in terms of the jya (bow-string).</li><li><em>499</em> — <em>Aryabhatiya</em> introduces sine, cos, and inverse sine (jya, koti-jya, utkrama-jya) as half angle half chord versions of those found in <em>Surya Siddhanta</em>.</li><li><em>~800</em> — Virasena calculate base 2,3, & 4 logarithms.</li><li><em>820</em> — Al-Khwārizmī writes <em>Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wal-muqābala</em>, or <em>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</em>.</li><li><em>1126</em> — Adelard of Bath translates Al-Khwārizmī&rsquo;s works on Indian numbers as <em>Dixit Algorizmi</em>.</li><li><em>1145</em> — Robert of Chester translates Al-Khwārizmī&rsquo;s book of &ldquo;algebra&rdquo; into Latin as <em>Liber algebrae et almucabala</em>.</li><li><em>1150</em> — Bhāskara II writes the Siddhānta Śiromani which lays out methods of trigonometry and calculus, but predated Newton and Leibniz.</li><li><em>1202</em> — Leonardo Fibonacci publishes <em>Liber Abaci</em>.

<a class=anchor href=#the-evolution-of-programming>#</a></h2><p>In the beginning, programming a machine was task full of tedium. One had to:</p><ul><li>Be intimately familiar with the hardware being used.</li><li>Analyze the scope of the computation.</li><li>Divide the computation into stages which can be performed on the hardware.</li><li>Plant out the logic and arithmetic of each task and how memory would be utilized.</li><li>Translate that logic, arithmetic, and storage instructions into machine code.</li><li>Input that code into the machine using an interface specific to each machine (wires, switches, punch cards, etc.).</li><li>Read out and record the output of the computation.</li></ul><p>Later, assemblers were invented that let people use architecture specific mnemonics called assembly language instead of binary, octal, or hexadecimal. In time, people like Grace Hopper came along and — in addition to removing physical bugs from the hardware — they created higher level languages. These were unique in several ways. One, they didn&rsquo;t require complete knowledge of the hardware. Two, while they still required some memory management, they could plan out memory address offsets and register usage automatically. Three, you could write a program on one machine architecture and it was likely that if the language became avalable on another machine architecture, it would still compile.</p><p>The next big evolution in programming was dynamic memory management. This meant a programmer no longer had to specifically plan out memory usage (in theory), but the language itself would plan out how and when to allocate and release memory. There was typically a reference counter for variables and when the reference count reached zero the memory would be released. This evolved into more advanced forms of garbage collection. Unfortunately, there were some unfortunate side effects. Sometimes people could write code which cause a rerference to stick around beyond its actual use, this lead to memory leaks. Also, in certain cases the garbage collector would cause some pretty awful hickups when it decided it was time to clean up during a critical moment. There are work-arounds, but they typically mean hacking the language into letting one plan out memory allocation manually.</p><p>There are a lot of patterns which have emerged over the decades, and there are many books written about them. A modicum of the patterns have libraries or frameworks which support them. Many of them don&rsquo;t, which means that programmers must build their own libraries or frameworks for many patterns.</p><p>By default, many programming languages support a text based environment because of the historical backwards compatiblility of only having a text based interface. When programs entered the world of visual interfaces, all of the graphics had to be drawn by the program, there was no library for visual interfaces. A program&rsquo;s graphics engine wrote directly to the video buffer (or virtual buffer, which was synchronously copied to the video buffer at the refresh rate to minimize visual artifacts). As graphical shells and operating systems like Windows, OS/2, and Mac OS became popular, programs would use a kind of object oriented approach to specify every aspect of the user interface in code. Every visual element on the screen would have multiple objects associated with them. Many properties had to be filled in programmatically in an imperative style. Messages would be dispatched to worker threads through a central dispatcher (a WindowProc in Windows). If a program needed a layout to resize as the window changed, all of the code for that behavior had to be manually written. Much code with different concerns was all grouped together around the associated objects. This started changing when Sun Microsystems released Java with its Abstract Windowing Toolkit and became easier with Swing. Along with those layout engines, the standards starting to brew around HTML + CSS started to make declarative UIs very appealing. many of those declarative approaches allow separating concerns around prsentation, content, and certain animations. Today, many application UI frameworks include an option for declaratively defining a UI layout because it has be come a best practice, even if it doesn&rsquo;t go far enough as an organizing principle.</p><h2 id=programming-is-stuck>Programming is Stuck
<a class=anchor href=#programming-is-stuck>#</a></h2><p>Fundamentally, nothing about programming interfaces has changed since 1997. Data exchange (or data binding, if you prefer) remains an issue; though it seems like a few patterns are being settled on, it is really a rehash of similar concepts from the 90&rsquo;s. Organizing code around UI and UX is still an issue. Making sure code is organized around various independent orthogonal issues seems to be a challenge. Most languages still place the burden on the programmer to manage where data is and how it is transferred around the system. Certain patterns have made many of these issues easier to solve. However, we still keep repeating ourselves over and over and reinventing the same wheel someone else invented in the 70s through 90s. Sometimes we get actual progress, and it&rsquo;s quite welcome.</p><p>We have an acronym to remind us not to do this: DRY, Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself. It is the maxim most programmers live by. It is why we build standard libraries, garbage collectors, frameworks, reusable bits of code, isomorphic coding, and many other things. However, there are certain things that always seem to need to be repeated with a few changes each time we add a new screen or form to an application. Things do not wire themselves into finished products.</p><figure><img src=//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ineffective_sorts.png><figcaption><h4>XKCD: "StackSort connects to StackOverflow, searches for 'sort a list', and downloads and runs code snippets until the list is sorted."</h4></figcaption></figure><hr><p><a href=http://adaburrows.com/docs/nkp/analyze-sota/>Next</a></p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/adaburrows/adaburrows.github.io/commit/49b126fcb7c120b84be6610ea785a5c419b155a3 title="Last modified by Jillian Ada Burrows | November 9, 2020" target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
