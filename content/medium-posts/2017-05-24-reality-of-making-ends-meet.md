title: 'Have we lost touch with the reality of making ends meet?'
date: '2017-05-24'
description: 'I saw a headline float past me recently. I vaguely remember something similar to "Can a gig economy survive with minimum wage?" It flew past as I flicked my screen in a different direction and all I caught was that question, begging me to answer it. Is a “gig economy” really any different than what we as humans have done in the past? Or is it just a buzz word that we’re tossing around because the employment situation looks grim and there’s technology to help facilitate the process?'
