description: 'Facebook and Twitter already know every link you click on and everything you’ve liked and every person you’ve even interacted with on their platform. However, their reach doesn’t stop there. Every time you visit a web page which uses an advertising platform as a partner (which might include Twitter, Facebook, or a number of others), those companies are informed of exactly which pages you visited on the Internet. They know which blogs you frequent, what news articles you read, and the items you might have considered buying. They may even know what sex toys you’ve been thinking of buying from the supposed comfort and privacy of your own bed.'
