title: 'Martin Luther King Jr. Stares Towards the 16th Street Baptist Church'
date: '2019-01-22'
description: 'I met MLKJ’s statue in Birmingham, AL. He’s on a platform, standing tall and regal. He’s looking across the way past the statues of the four little girls frozen in time, where they likely used to play on the street corner, towards the church where those four girls were killed by a group of racists who planted a bomb intended for organizers at the church.'
