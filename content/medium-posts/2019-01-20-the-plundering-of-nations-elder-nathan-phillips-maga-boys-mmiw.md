title: 'The Plundering of Nations, Elder Nathan Phillips, the MAGA Boys, and MMIW'
date: '2019-01-20'
description: 'The conflict between elder Nathan Phillips and the #MAGA kids is more than racism. The kids who were harassing the Omaha Nation elder may have been racist, but itâ€™s still about the plundering of nations. Women and children disappear from reservation territory daily. The current laws make #MMIW cases likely fall under federal jurisdiction, but with additional complications and holes.'
