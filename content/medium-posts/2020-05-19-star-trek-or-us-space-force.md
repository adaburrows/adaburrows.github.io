title: 'Star Trek or US Space Force?'

description: 'Since this administration unfurled the new official emblem for the Space Force. Many people, including actors from Star Trek, have raised issues with how similar it looks to the Starfleet Command logo. It turns out itâ€™s no accident that this has happened, but not for the reasons you probably think. When Star Trek came on the air in the 60s, there was already a long legacy of the Air Force using similar logos and seals going back to at least 1935. Star Trek has borrowed from real life on numerous occasions, from riffing off the UN for the United Federation of planets in Star Trek The Motion Picture from 1979 to the mirror universe Terran Empire emblem.'
