title: 'The State of Functional Programming in PHP 5.3.x'
date: '2011-06-24'
summary: 'A few weeks ago, I started looking into the possibility of functional programming in PHP. I stumbled across the capability of defining anonymous functions â€” starting with PHP 5.3.0. These can be used to define closures with bound variables and also for partial application or currying. Higher order functions can also be defined.'
