It was far too short of a time. I felt at home there, among the water protectors. The camp technically begins on the reservation with a group known as the Rosebud Camp. Most of it is actually just north of a bridge with signs marking that one is leaving the reservation. It would be easy to just say it is on US Army Corps of Engineers’ land, however in the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie the land of the Sioux stretches upward along the Missouri River and all the way along the Heart River, which flows just south of Bismarck and through Mandan. The camp barely touches that vast swath of land.</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/@adaburrows/understanding-standing-rock-6b6e8e5a9d5><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><i class="fab fa-medium"></i>&nbsp;<a href=https://medium.com/@adaburrows/robert-bobby-f-kennedy-jr-speaks-at-standing-rock-67e8b0931625>Robert “Bobby” F.

I was slightly more hungover than expected and, somehow, slightly more entangled in the soul of a friend who, just over a week ago, was hit by a car going full speed while trying to flag down help. At first, she was someone who talked to me at the local bar where she worked. Eventually, our relationship grew little by little. Before long we were talking about art, our traumas and struggles in life, and how we wanted the world to change. About a month ago, she told me, “I’m doing it. I’m giving my notice. I’m going to work on art full time. You should come by my studio sometime and we should work on a project together.” Replying excitedly, I said, “That would be awesome! Yes, let’s plan on it.” — which was all I could get in before she hurried off down the bar to serve a new customer, popping by every now and then to exchange a few words. It was becoming obvious our friendship was blossoming beyond what the structure of hanging out at the bar while she worked could hold.</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/@adaburrows/soul-upgrade-9585c378329d><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><i class="fab fa-medium"></i>&nbsp;<a href=https://medium.com/@adaburrows/what-do-school-shootings-tell-us-about-our-culture-ba75379cc03>What do school shootings tell us about our culture?</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span class=date>Sat, Oct 3, 2015</span></div></header><p>We should broaden the context from the strict definition of mental illness to general mental health and coping mechanisms.

He’s a 14 year old boy of Sudanese descent who happens to be an American kid and Muslim (why blame a kid for his religion?). His father happens to have run for presidency in Sudan, twice. Should any of that matter in this case? No, but it seems to have mattered. According to CNN, the teacher to whom he showed the clock was the one who felt threatened. Now, it might be arguable it was just the appearance of an eight inch wide metal pencil box with a time readout that caused the worry. I would say that’s an argument made out of ignorance and poor education regarding electronics.</p><footer><a href=https://medium.com/@adaburrows/how-to-make-a-time-b-i-mean-timepiece-377789c10435><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><i class="fab fa-wordpress"></i>&nbsp;<a href=https://jburrows.wordpress.com/2014/11/18/abbreviating-numbers/>Abbreviating Huge and Minuscule Numbers with Math and JavaScript</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span class=date>Tue, Nov 18, 2014</span></div></header><p>I’m sure there are quite a few ways to do this.

The PHP team is working to bring to some very nice presents to PHP developers. In the previous release of 5.3.0 they had added a few language changes. This version is no different. Some of the other changes include the ability to use DTrace for watching PHP apps in BSD variants (there is a loadable kernel module for Linux folks). This release features many speed and security improvements along with some phasing out of older language features (Y2K compliance is no longer optional). The mysql extensions for ext/mysql, mysqli, and pdo now use the MySql native driver (mysqlnd). This release also improves support for multibyte strings.</p><footer><a href=https://jburrows.wordpress.com/2011/12/17/what-to-look-for-in-php-5-4-0/><nobr>Read more →</nobr></a></footer></article><article class="markdown book-post"><header><h2><i class="fab fa-wordpress"></i>&nbsp;<a href=https://jburrows.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/the-state-of-functional-programming-in-php-5-3-x/>The State of Functional Programming in PHP 5.3.x</a></h2><div class=post-meta><span class=date>Fri, Jun 24, 2011</span></div></header><p>A few weeks ago, I started looking into the possibility of functional programming in PHP.
