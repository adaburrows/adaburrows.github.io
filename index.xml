I was also told that multiplication was repeated addition. I took this at face value and I though that this was how computers calculated things. It made sense for integers. It made sense that one could cheat repeated addition for powers of two by bit shifting and not repeated addition on platforms that only have addition, but not multiplication.</description></item><item><title>Perceptual + Narrative Zones</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/docs/narrative-culture/perceptual-zones/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/docs/narrative-culture/perceptual-zones/</guid><description>This is a draft of what will likely become a book detailing how our minds form culture based on shared experiences and a Nash-like equilibrium of cultural dynamics.
Perceptual + Narrative Zones Perceptual Zones Each individual (an agent) has their own perceptual zone which differs from other people&amp;rsquo;s perceptual zones. The perceptual zones may overlap, but in many case they don&amp;rsquo;t. The perceptual zone is the combined whole of experience each individual is perceiving and sense-making at any given time.</description></item><item><title>What is Programming About?</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/docs/nkp/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/docs/nkp/introduction/</guid><description>Next
This is a work in progress. It will likely become a book at some point.
What is Programming About? Originally, computers were people hired by the government or other large business. They would do large numbers of potentially complicated computations by hand and file the results back and forth. &amp;ldquo;Programming&amp;rdquo; back then was figuring out how all of the work for a computation should be doled out to individuals or groups and how results from one group should be given to another group for further computation.</description></item><item><title>Analyzing the State of the Art</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/docs/nkp/analyze-sota/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/docs/nkp/analyze-sota/</guid><description>This is a work in progress. It will likely become a book at some point.
Analyzing the State of the Art With todays applications, there is typically a focus on serving large numbers of people across multiple platforms. This is complicated by those various platforms requiring different languages and technologies in order to implement each part. Many languages have been focused on incremental improvements over previous languages. This is also the case for many web technologies.</description></item><item><title>Ice Age Map</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/docs/ice-age/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/docs/ice-age/</guid><description>Ice Age Map I have a vision to create a virtual world where the history and multiple heritages of humanity are visible and explorable. The virtual world should be able to simlate the tectonic plates, the climate, and the ocean levels. In the videos and map below, there is a very different picture of the land masses during the ice age than today. Current research shows that many centers of our civilization may actually be underwater from the rise in sea level.</description></item><item><title>Star Trek or US Space Force?</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-05-19-star-trek-or-us-space-force/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-05-19-star-trek-or-us-space-force/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Dissecting the virus</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-04-10-coronavirus-sars-cov2-dissecting-the-virus/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-04-10-coronavirus-sars-cov2-dissecting-the-virus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Coronavirus SARS-CoV2: 03/17/2020</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-03-17-coronavirus-sars-cov2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-03-17-coronavirus-sars-cov2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Our Broken Realities</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-02-10-our-broken-realities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2020-02-10-our-broken-realities/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A History of Amazon Deforestation</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2019-11-14-a-history-of-amazon-deforestation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2019-11-14-a-history-of-amazon-deforestation/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Root Beer’s Indigenous Roots</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2019-07-21-root-beers-indigneous-roots/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2019-07-21-root-beers-indigneous-roots/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Origin of Concentration Camps</title><link>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2019-07-31-the-origin-of-concentration-camps/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://adaburrows.com/medium-posts/2019-07-31-the-origin-of-concentration-camps/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Help!
