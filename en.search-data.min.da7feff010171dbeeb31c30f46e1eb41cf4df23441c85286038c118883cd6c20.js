I was also told that multiplication was repeated addition. I took this at face value and I though that this was how computers calculated things. It made sense for integers. It made sense that one could cheat repeated addition for powers of two by bit shifting and not repeated addition on platforms that only have addition, but not multiplication.\n  \\[\\begin{aligned} 2^5 \u0026amp; = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\\\ 2^5 \u0026amp; = 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \\\\ \u0026amp; \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \\\\ \u0026amp; \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \\\\ \u0026amp; \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \u0026#43; 2 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]  Then I momentarily thought about square roots, because the square root of two can be written two ways:\n \\[\\sqrt{2} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\]  Using the mental framework with which my teachers had equiped me, meant that two is being multiplied by itself one-half times. This, of course, made no sense. How can one apply an operation a fractional amount of times? So then I wondered if looking at this in terms of addition would help, but that was a fractional amount too:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} p \u0026amp; = b^m \\\\ p \u0026amp; = sb \\\\ sb \u0026amp; = b^m \\\\ s \u0026amp; = b^{m-1} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]  Lets check our original example of  \\(2^5\\)   \\[\\begin{aligned} m \u0026amp; = \\log_2 2^5 = 5 \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{and} \\\\ s \u0026amp; = 2^{m-1} = 2^4 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]  That checks out, but what about  \\(2^\\frac{1}{2}\\)  ?\n \\[\\begin{aligned} m \u0026amp; = \\log_2 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{and} \\\\ s \u0026amp; = 2^{m-1} = 2^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]  Of course, this is even more mystical because how does one apply addition ~0.707106 times? Fortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s a clue hidden in that  \\(\\log_2\\)  function. But it\u0026rsquo;s not super obvious exactly how that helps us, at least not upon first glance. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry we\u0026rsquo;ll get there.\nLogarithms #  Logarithms are interesting concept. Base ten logarithms let us know the magnitude of a decimal based number. A base two logarithm can let us know in which octave a frequency belongs. A base two logarithm can also let us know how many digits are needed to represent a number. Base two logarithms are found in measurements of entropy.\nMathematically, logarithms are pretty simple. They form a mapping from multiplication to addition:\n \\[\\log(a^m) \u0026#43; \\log(a^n) = \\log(a^{m}a^{n})\\]  Additionally, they have the following relationships:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} y \u0026amp; = b^x \\text{, the exponential function in base b} \\\\ x \u0026amp; = \\log_b y \\text{, the logarithm in base b} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]  Additionally, one can change the base of the logarithm simply by scaling the logarithm:\n \\[\\log_{b_2} y = \\frac{\\log_{b_1} y}{\\log_{b_1} b_2}\\]  Since, the base doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, we can use the natural logarithm:\n \\[\\log_{b_2} y = \\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln b_2}\\]  The most commonly occuring logarithm is the natural logarithm, in base  \\(e\\)  :\n \\[\\begin{aligned} x \u0026amp; = \\ln e^x \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]  Using the identities above we can get:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} y \u0026amp; = b^x \\\\ \\log_{b} y \u0026amp; = \\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln b} \\\\ \\log_{b} y \\ln b \u0026amp; = \\ln y \\\\ x \\ln b \u0026amp; = \\ln y \\\\ e^{x \\ln b} \u0026amp; = e^{\\ln y} \\\\ e^{x \\ln b} \u0026amp; = y \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]  This means that if we can figure out a way to compute  \\(\\ln x\\)  and  \\(e^x\\)  for any value  \\(x\\)  , then we can compute any  \\(y = b^x\\)  by using  \\(y = e^{x \\ln b}\\)  . Fortunately, using calculus we can figure out approximations for these functions. The process of doing so is called analytic continuation.\nAnalytic Continuation #  One of the most common introductions to the natural logarithm (besides the relationships and maps above), is the simple integral:\n \\[\\ln(x) = \\int_{1}^{x}\\frac{dt}{t}\\]  This next graph is a combination of computing the area under the curve  \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\)  from 1 to 2 along with  \\(\\ln x\\)  ,  \\(e^x\\)  , and  \\(x\\)  :\n  As should be obvious from the chart above, the exponential and the logarithm are inverses of each other are are reflections along the values of  \\(y = x\\)  . This means that if we can calculate one of these we can calculate both just by transposing the coordinate values.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a problem with this though. The above integral definition of  \\(\\ln\\)  is very limited in some important ways:\n It really can\u0026rsquo;t be extended into complex numbers, because the integral from  \\(1\\)  to  \\(a \u0026#43; b\\imath\\)  is not defined without specifying an exact curve over which to integrate. The full integral needs to be computed, which limits its practicality in calculating a number to a certain precision within a small number of operations.  Fortunately, there are easily found analytic definitions for these functions using the method of Taylor series expansion. As an added benefit, these support imaginary and complex numbers in their domain:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} e^x \u0026amp; = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{x^k}{k!} \\\\ \\ln x \u0026amp; = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{k\u0026#43;1}}{k}(x-1)^k \\\\ \\ln (1 \u0026#43; x) \u0026amp; = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}{\\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}}x^{k} \\end{aligned}\\]  There are some other identities that can come in handy because they tend to converge quickly. For when x falls with the complex unit circle:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} \\ln x \u0026amp; = 2\\operatorname{artanh}\\left(\\frac{x-1}{x\u0026#43;1}\\right) \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2k\u0026#43;1}\\left(\\frac{x-1}{x\u0026#43;1}\\right)^{2k\u0026#43;1} \\end{aligned}\\]  When x is outside the complex unit circle:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} \\ln x \u0026amp; = 2\\operatorname{arcoth}\\left(\\frac{x\u0026#43;1}{x-1}\\right) \\\\ \u0026amp; = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2k\u0026#43;1}\\left(\\frac{x\u0026#43;1}{x-1}\\right)^{-(2k\u0026#43;1)} \\end{aligned}\\]  There are some issues to be aware of around complex logarithms. To demonstrate these issues, we need Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula:\n \\[e^{\\theta\\imath} = \\cos\\theta \u0026#43;\\imath\\sin\\theta \\]  Wait! We need a more complicated formula:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} c^{a\u0026#43;b\\imath} \u0026amp; = e^{c \\ln a} e^{\\imath c \\ln b} \\\\ \u0026amp; = e^{c \\ln a} \\left( \\cos (c \\ln b) \u0026#43;\\imath\\sin (c \\ln b) \\right) \\end{aligned}\\]  Since this has a periodic aspect to it, that means there are infinitely many loagrithms of a complex number. This is important to keep in mind, since some of the formulae above don\u0026rsquo;t seem to mind this. For instance those hyperbolic identities above only give what is called the \u0026ldquo;principle value\u0026rdquo;. This means the other infinitude of values are neglected, but can be computed from this.\nPutting It All Together #  The analytic formulae all have summations between 0 or 1 and infinity. Computers don\u0026rsquo;t really like infinities because it takes them an infinite amount of time to deal with them. This means we\u0026rsquo;ve got to cheat. Cheating is easy: we just use a few terms of the analytic function. However, we still need to be mindful of the errors. The Taylor series really only has good accurracy for logarithms within a certain distance from the point we expanded the series around. In our case, that point is zero.\nSince we know that the logarithm and exponential are realy the same thing just rotated around the the identity function, we can choose which ever one has the better convergence and then iteratively solve for a value using a variant of Newton\u0026rsquo;s method. In the case using the exponential, we just need to be careful of the large values generated in the factorials. Then we iteratively converge on the value we know while solving for the exponent.\nUsing everything we know about logarithms and exponents, we can set up a way to solve for  \\(\\sqrt x\\)  :\n \\[\\sqrt x = e^{\\frac{1}{2}\\ln x}\\]  Visually, we can see these relationships as:\n  More generally, we can setup a general  \\(n^{th}\\)  root:\n \\[\\sqrt[n] x = e^{\\frac{1}{n}\\ln x}\\]  This means we have found a general mechanism for performing  \\(n^{th}\\)  roots, or, more awkwardly, multiplying x by itself  \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\)  times. But more than that, we have a general method for calculating roots, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions themselves. Because of Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula, we can easily write:\n \\[\\begin{aligned} \\cos\\theta \u0026amp; = \\frac{e^{\\theta\\imath} \u0026#43; e^{-\\theta\\imath}}{2} \\\\ \\sin\\theta \u0026amp; = \\frac{e^{\\theta\\imath} - e^{-\\theta\\imath}}{2\\imath} \\\\ \\tan \\theta \u0026amp; = \\frac{e^{\\theta\\imath} - e^{-\\theta\\imath}}{\\imath(e^{\\theta\\imath} \u0026#43; e^{-\\theta\\imath})} \\end{aligned}\\]  All of these methods arise from the relationships found in one particular equation:\n \\[b^x = e^{x \\ln b}\\]  What Does This Mean? #  My preferred way of thinking about this, is integers are really a special case where our notational system happens to have the most simplicity for notating those numbers. They are points of minimal encoding, but they are just as complicated or information dense as any other algebraic number. This is how two infinite sums can be found in integer relationships to each other.\nBy asking the question I started with — \u0026ldquo;How do we multiply a number by itself a fractional number of times?\u0026rdquo; — we can find out new things about our numbers and operations. It is questions and answers like this which make me wonder what is more fundamental in terms of operations. Are fields with addition and groups with multiplication realy fundamental? Or is everything that we do really just an approximation or convergence of an infinity of terms reducing to a point for as long as it\u0026rsquo;s needed or convienient for our minds?\nIs anything as simple as  \\(2\u0026#43;1\\)  ? Maybe it all is as complicated as:  \\[\\begin{aligned} 2\u0026#43;1 \u0026amp; = e^{x \\ln 2} \\\\ x \u0026amp; = \\frac{\\ln 2 \u0026#43; 1}{\\ln 2} \\\\ 3 \u0026amp; = e^{\\ln 2 \u0026#43; 1} \\end{aligned}\\]  "});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/narrative-culture/perceptual-zones/','title':"Perceptual + Narrative Zones",'content':" This is a draft of what will likely become a book detailing how our minds form culture based on shared experiences and a Nash-like equilibrium of cultural dynamics.\n Perceptual + Narrative Zones #  Perceptual Zones #  Each individual (an agent) has their own perceptual zone which differs from other people\u0026rsquo;s perceptual zones. The perceptual zones may overlap, but in many case they don\u0026rsquo;t. The perceptual zone is the combined whole of experience each individual is perceiving and sense-making at any given time.\n  Image 1Two visual perceptual zones looking towards each other and overlapping\n  There are at least two principal divisions of perceptual zones: Interior + Exterior. These different zones are also supported by the concepts of external and internal focalization in literature.\nThe exterior division is that created by the senses, presumably, which is possible to experience together with someone also physically present and presumably caused by a physicality (but could potentially be caused by a defect in perception, i.e. an illusion): brightness, color, smell, taste, texture, temperature, touch, movement, loudness, frequency, etc. It should be obvious that this is not necessarily entirely shared by all people, since some people lack color perception or visual perception entirely, some people cannot hear, etc.\nThe interior division is created by the mind reacting to the stream of input created by either the exterior perception, the imagination, or other feedback loops within itself: imagination, emotions, thoughts, inferences, anything one experiences which isn\u0026rsquo;t readily accessible or perceivable to a one whom is not a mind reader.\nUsually, human\u0026rsquo;s integrate perceptual zones into narratives. Narratives of stories are typically easy to remember.\nForming Narratives #  Every person is selective in what they choose to pay attention. Each person will create a different narrative about the events going on around them. Each person also has their own internal perceptions of their own internal state. A person forming a narrative about someone else will only draw upon the external qualities they perceive about someone else, unless there has been some interaction that allowed them to know another person\u0026rsquo;s interior state. If someone were able to only focus on external qualities and happenings, without any interpretation of those qualities and happenings and without implying anything, they might come to a very objective description of their limited view. In writing, this is known as external focalization. However, very rarely does anyone\u0026rsquo;s narrative about an experience happen in external focalization. Typically, it also includes a host of feelings, internal state, and assumptions about other people\u0026rsquo;s' internal state. Objective descriptions about what is going on can have an interesting effect, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t read like internal thoughts.\nThis is an example of external focalization:\n Three ladies stood up after having sat and talked around a large, wooden table. The table\u0026rsquo;s wood stain was worn and fading from its age. The ladies had talked for over an hour. As they were walking towards the door, the barista called out, \u0026ldquo;See you all later.\u0026rdquo; They all waved, and continued talking as they walked. The three ladies walked out the coffee shop door and rounded a corner of the shop. They walked on a sidewalk bordered by rocks and a patch of grass and continued around around the other corner. They continued out to the parking lot next to the boardwalk along the docks.\nA giant fabric sign saying \u0026ldquo;ESPRESSO\u0026rdquo; in curvy all-caps waved in the breeze. Along the other side of the boardwalk, an American flag, US Army flag, US Navy flag, and US Marine flag all waved in a line. A lady wearing a blue shirt and black exercise crops walked a dog. They passed by on the other side of the window. The whole time I sat in my chair, wearing my green shirt, surrounded by my phone, tablet, battery pack, laptop, and camera all atop the wooden table.\n It is purely descriptive of the physical world and the readily perceivable. The compliment to this would be internal focalization. It would be filled with emotions, thoughts, and ideas of what might be going on inside another\u0026rsquo;s mind. For example:\n I am in a small coastal town in Oregon. I want coffee and a space to turn that coffee into words for my blog. I remember my last visit to this same town and the decent coffee shop I discovered by the harbor. As I drive there in the fog, I ponder what I\u0026rsquo;ll write. I am distracted by my enjoyment of the fog. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice break from the heat I just came from. I roll down my windows and expose my face to the cool moisture outside.\nI arrive and notice a inflated tube of fabric flailing about in the wind around the corner from the shop. Wondering if those things do anything to grab people\u0026rsquo;s attentions, I walk around to other side of the building. As I open the door and enter, I take in the scent of the coffee beans. The smell is enough to start invigorating me. This is now my second time visiting this year and I\u0026rsquo;m becoming used to this place and its wooden furniture. I feel I\u0026rsquo;m likely to return many times.\nI move to the counter to order. The barista is fumbling around trying get a few things in order behind the counter. I remember her as the barista that never talked to me last time. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if she\u0026rsquo;s an introvert or if she just doesn\u0026rsquo;t like me. I\u0026rsquo;m not quick to judge. It might take a few more visits before she warms up to me. Eventually, she notices me and with a cold distance asks what I\u0026rsquo;d like. .I order my latte and oatmeal. I reach to grab my wallet out of my bag, but it\u0026rsquo;s not there. I left my wallet back in my car. I explain this hoping she won\u0026rsquo;t get upset with me. Fortunately she seems fine with the mishap. I leave to fetch my wallet and come back.\nI return and enter through the only door. There are two people impatiently waiting for her to even acknowledge their presence. They pace back and forth as though they might leave. After a short while, she notices me standing to the side of the counter and goes to enter my order into the register. She comes back and tells me my total. I hand her a twenty dollar bill and she fetches my change. The others are still waiting.\nFinally, she takes their order and payment. She finishes up their drinks fairly quickly. Once they step outside, she starts reading her book. I start thinking maybe she\u0026rsquo;s not the greatest with customer service or making use of down time to organize what she\u0026rsquo;ll need. While I\u0026rsquo;m observing all this, I unpack my digital goodies and set them haphazardly about me. A little disorganization helps me start writing.\n This internal narrative ascribes motivations and starts hinting towards goals for each agent in addition to outlining the state of mind and emotion of the agent described. It takes some of the guesswork out of why certain agents actions are what they are. On the other hand, it could also be used to highlight the different thought processes each agent possesses. It can also be used to create tension or conflict by having characters ascribe incorrect motivations, reasons, or other driving factors to the other characters actions.\nNow imagine if we could take two narratives about the same situation from different perspectives, both with internal focalization, and lay them side by side. We could see how they differ by how far away the lines are from each other. The closer the lines are, the more alike the perceptions are and the less likely conflict is to arise. The farther they are apart, the more different the perceptions are. We could even add a layer of external narratives in between the two internal narratives to see the differences in what each person experiences in the scene that others might also observe.\nImagine others' experiences sitting in the coffee shop with me. Some are travelers, while some are locals and regulars. All of them arrive at the shop and observe a subset of the same environment. Some of them might be self absorbed, others might be more focused on what is going on outside, and others might be focused on the other people in the room. We are all in the same location, there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of commonality there. Because of the selectivity of their attention, these experiences differ. Each person notices different aspects of the environment and would accentuate those bits in writing an objective description of their experience. Each person also has their own mental place and reason for being there. When people come to the same geographic location and the same room, their narratives get closer together in some dimensions \u0026mdash; if they\u0026rsquo;re paying attention to those dimensions.\nOne person might be at the coffee shop to focus on reading. Another couple might be getting a cup of coffee to wake them up while going on a walk. Others might be there to catch up over a cup of coffee. In many of the situations, the physical space is not as important as the function the coffee serves in their plans for the day or the closeness of the group\u0026rsquo;s interactions.\nIf we lay these individual strands of narrative beside one another, we\u0026rsquo;ll find a few different patterns. All of these individual strands of narrative get closer together once they enter the coffee shop. If the group of people sitting at the table conversing came from different places, their stands would start out further apart and begin to converge and become close to, but distinctly separate, from the other strands of narrative. Their individual experiences would be woven into narratives more similar than other narratives in the same room. Their narratives would be distinctly different from mine. I was just sitting down by myself to write my thoughts down. Their narratives would also be different from the lady behind me reading a novel, just that lady and my narrative differ by our action in the coffee shop.\nNarrative Diagrams #  Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve properly outlined the meaning and context behind the internal and the external narratives, these two strands can be used to weave a narrative diagram for one agent:\n  Figure 1   The main states any pair of narratives can occupy are either consonant or dissonant. The relative amount of space between narratives indicates the amount of consonance or dissonance. Sometimes there can be conflict between an agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative and external narrative, as indicated by dissonance between the two narratives. This is created through divergence between internal and external narratives, optionally any number of \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; narratives may be present.\n  Figure 2      Figure 3     When two narratives go from being consonant to being dissonant, they are said to diverge. When two narratives go from being dissonant to consonant, they are said to converge. This is represented in the diagram as divergence (Fig. 3) and convergence (Fig. 4).\n  Figure 4      Figure 5     Different kinds of false narratives can happen. A false narrative can either be congruent to one of the narrative strands or it can be congruent to none of the narrative strands. Typically it\u0026rsquo;s defined as being false compared to the internal narrative (an agent\u0026rsquo;s primary source of self- knowledge) or false compared to the reality and self-knowledge, as in Fig. 7, where it\u0026rsquo;s divergent and dissonant with both internal and external narratives.\n  Figure 6      Figure 7     An aspect of this way of diagramming situations is each of these diagrams lacks explicit detail and can represent many different situations. What it brings is a way of diagramming the spaces certain actors and relationships occupy \u0026ndash; it can emphasize the distance between mental space and physical space of both. Before delving into the ways this demonstrates relationships with others let us examine how it can demonstrate relationship with self.\nIn Fig. 1, the agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative and external narrative stay consonant and track one another as they both change. They could be riding a horse at a fast clip and their mind doesn\u0026rsquo;t wander, but stays in a flow monitoring their environment as close as possible.\nFig. 4 shows the agent\u0026rsquo;s internal and external narratives diverging. No \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; narrative is created in this case. This could be someone working on a hard problem at their computer, whiteboard, or couch, then leaving for a walk but their mind remains focused on the same problem, more distant from their immediate surroundings. Perhaps they were dreaming about taking a trip to place far away, arriving at the airport though they were still waiting in line to order lunch. Perhaps a tragic accident occurred and they are in shock or denial. Perhaps they went through puberty and look and act like a typical straight person, but despite what anyone else thinks, they are actually not straight and they make no attempt to mask that, but they don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;code\u0026rdquo; for it either.\nFig. 5 shows the agent\u0026rsquo;s external narrative converging towards their internal narrative. This could indicate they were at work, but day dreaming of going and buying the latest Allen \u0026amp; Heath studio mixing console for their studio they also own and use during the weekends. Then as they leave work and go buy the mixing console, their external narrative comes into consonance with their internal narrative.\nFig. 6 is interesting because it diagrams an agent for whom an internal narrative has diverged from their external narrative (or v.v.), while they have created a separate internal narrative to match the external narrative, or, rather, to match what they believe other agents' internal narratives are for a corresponding external narrative. In contrast to this is Fig. 7, which is an outright lie created knowing full well what one\u0026rsquo;s external narrative is and actually being in agreement with it. The relationship of self to the perceivable worlds is incongruent in the case of Fig. 6, but the relationship of the false narrative is dissonant to the perceivable reality in Fig. 7.\nFig. 6 represents a life lived inauthentically or a moment where other\u0026rsquo;s impressions become the driving force. An example of this archetype would be someone \u0026ldquo;in the closet\u0026rdquo;. Perhaps they married someone they were expected to marry even if they were never sexually attracted to them. Perhaps they are transsexual and are living the role assigned to them at birth. In order to accomplish this, they have created a \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; narrative which is in great conflict with their internal narrative which is also dissonant with the perceivable reality (the external narrative). This places a great strain on an individual.\nThis could also represent the beginning of stereotype threat, where one\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative is quite different from what someone expects of you and you let their stereotypical projection onto you drive a false narrative. This may resolve itself quickly, or it might drive tensions with self for a while.\nHow do these strands of narrative interact with other people\u0026rsquo;s strands of narrative? This is where it gets interesting, because there are quite a few combinations. The basics are the same as laid out above. Instead of just one internal and external narrative, there become as many pairs as there are agents.\n  Figure 8Two agents' external narratives overlap in a shared perceptual field\n  Fig. 8 represents two people coming into the other\u0026rsquo;s perceptual fields, sharing part of their physical reality, but not much of their inner reality. This is the equivalent of the visual field overlap illustrated in Image 1. Two fields of perception come close enough that there is enough information to map one onto the other, even if imperfectly. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of potential variation in these diagrams, especially if the inner narrative is allowed to cross over the external narrative to allow for people building similar thoughts and inner narratives.\nThe full set of possibilities is derived through the following rules:\n Apply one operation of:  Diverge Converge Transpose   Account for symmetries between the two agents to remove redundant relationships:  If the two agents can be transposed and it results in the same relationships between agents, then the state is symmetric. Clusters of consonances are typically always symmetrical, except that external narratives always represent a division into individuals so the order of the cluster does matter, since a transposition of the internal narrative across the external narratives is not symmetrical.      Figure 9The derivation of the 13 possible states from the rules described above\n  These configurations represent the following 13 states:\n  Two agents with external experiences which are closely congruent with one another. Their internal narratives are consonant with their external narratives, but they may be thinking of different things.\n This is a fairly common situation. It describes two people who have nearly overlapping spheres of perception, but yet are thinking about things which are different, yet may still reference the same objects in the possibly overlapping areas of their environment. This could be two people sitting at a counter in the same bar. They might even be talking to each other, but they haven\u0026rsquo;t yet reached the state where their minds are closer than their bodies, as in j.\n   Two agents with external narratives which are dissonant with one another. Their internal narratives are congruent with their external narratives, but they are definitely having different experiences.\n Wašté Wiŋ is riding her horse through a field completely engrossed in the glory of the shining sun at near noon and and the medicine she flys over while navigating the 6 directions. Her brother is sitting in a couch hidden in the shadows of their home\u0026rsquo;s basement playing video games, he is similarly in a state of flow [but this narrator doesn\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s as healthy].\n   Two agents with consonant external narratives. One agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative is consonant with their external narratives, while the other agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative is dissonant with the all other narratives.\n Harriet and Oscar sit in their Scion as it glides across the mountain highway. Soon they will be at their destination. Harriet sits ponderously distant in the passenger seat while Oscar is immediately present taking curve around the mountain with ease.\n   Two agents with consonant external narratives. Each agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narratives are dissonant with their external narratives.\n Jillian and Sky sit side by side at the coffee shop. Though they are best friends, they have separate lives and each is focused on their tasks and emails whose invisible ties link them to friends and colleagues far away.\n   Two agents with dissonant external narratives. One agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative is distinctly dissonant with their external narrative. One agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative is consonant with their external narrative.\n Far away from his sister Tiffany, Arnold is engrossed in World of Warcraft so much so he forgets about how much his butt and bladder actually hurts from sitting so long focused on the virtual campaign he\u0026rsquo;s leading. Meanwhile, Tiffany is practicing yoga a state away, focusing on every bodily sensation and breath.\n   Two agents with dissonant external narratives. Each agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narratives are also distinctly dissonant with their external narratives.\n Jasmine reclines in her hammock in Mars Colony One\u0026rsquo;s residence hall. She is dreaming of the vast cosmos and the most recent fast radio burst (FRB) which was detected. She ponders if there is another intelligence here in the universe. Meanwhile back on Earth her distant cousin Marta is laying on the reddish-brown clay soil next to the river and the red willows which surround her in her Nevada homelands. Her mind is thinking about how all of life is one organism, still sharing most of its original DNA and RNA, constantly searching out new forms and ways of being. She realizes she is just one branch of the tree turned sideways in time which we call humanity. Each part has something to offer and something to learn from every other part \u0026ndash; if we can really call anything an \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo;.\n   Two agents with consonant external narratives. Their internal narratives are more consonant with each other than their external narratives.\n Eugene and Jackie are naked in bed on top of each other. Their minds are just as entwined in each other as their bodies are, each thinking of how in the moment to best pleasure the other. Their bodies writhe together in undulating passion.\n   Two agents with dissonant external narratives. Their internal narratives are consonant with each other and consonant with one external narrative.\n Jared is a remote client joining a conference with Tina, the lead architect. She is screen sharing her laptop screen while she sits in an office conference room talking about the building design on her screen. Both are focused on what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the conference room, and not what\u0026rsquo;s happening at Jared\u0026rsquo;s physical location.\n   Two agents with consonant external narratives. Their internal narratives are consonant with each other, but dissonant from their external narratives.\n Mario and Luigi are playing their Sega Genesis, each embodying their in-game characters while they both sit on the couch. Both of their minds are occupied by the same in game experiences, while their bodies also share the same physical environment.\n   Two agents with dissonant external narratives.

Both agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narratives are consonant with the other agent\u0026rsquo;s external narrative.\n Chadricia and Patwyn are are performing an experiment with VR and telepresence over Internet2. They are each in different countries: Chadricia is in London, UK while Patwin is in California, USA. They each wear a VR headset with a camera and x-y microphone setup. Instead of augmented reality where each person\u0026rsquo;s perception is modified and then fed back to the same person, they are experiencing each other\u0026rsquo;s perspective instead of their own.\n   Two agents with consonant external narratives and dissonant internal narratives. Both agent\u0026rsquo;s internal narratives are consonant with the other agent\u0026rsquo;s external narrative.\n Bianca wakes up next to her newborn son she just slept with outside her body for the first time, but realizes she is experiencing all the bodily sensations of her newborn and feels her own body pressing up against the tiny body she is experiencing. She thinks to herself, Could my baby be experiencing a dream of being older and having my form?\n   Enumerating the transitions from each option to the next option, will not be undertaken in the present work, but it does enumerate to 78 (13 choose 2) possible transitional archetypes of movements through both internal and physical space. As the magnitude of the changes can differ, this offers a near infinite amount of variety.\nA Deeper Look at False Narratives #  False narratives are narratives which are inserted between internal and external narratives (between self) or between external narratives (between selves). In other words, a false narrative can be about internal conflict and inauthenticity to self (type a) or lies (type b). The list of situations which fall under type a is staggering.\nEach of the diagrams presented above leave out any mention of false narratives. This is because including them would complicate matters and make the archetypes even harder to understand. However, wherever there is divergence/dissonance between two agents or divergence/dissonance between one agent\u0026rsquo;s internal and external narrative, a false narrative can be inserted. This means that a subset of seven of the diagrams [c,b,d,e,f,k,l] can be easily mutated to include one or more false narratives.\nWhat about false beliefs? Can these be represented in these diagrams? A false belief would be woven into the the fabric of one\u0026rsquo;s internal narrative regardless of any external narrative past of present. This would manifest itself is as a rift between internal narratives, one containing the false belief and one not containing the false belief, in a conversation where a counterexample to the false narrative is not present in consonant external narratives. It could also manifest itself as a divergence between an internal narrative containing the false belief and consonant internal and external narratives containing a counterexample to the false belief. Agents who do not hold the false belief, but an internal narrative holding a belief in harmony with their external narrative containing a counterexample negating the false belief may be able to highlight the false belief in a diagram by diagramming a false narrative which is co-divergent and consonant with the narrative containing the false belief.\nThere is a structural similarity between false narratives and narratives containing false beliefs \u0026mdash; diverging internal narratives, possibly also diverging from an external narrative \u0026mdash; a false belief is labeled with with a false narrative which is consonant with the internal narrative containing the false belief; while a false narrative corresponding to a stereotype threat, internal conflict, or inauthentic life is consonant with the external narrative or other agents' internal narratives. In essence, a stereotype threat is one labeling others internal narratives as containing false narratives. This is probably why these situations can be so difficult to speak of in detail. It becomes an us vs. them situation. In some cases, the facts in the external narratives have no correlation to the nature of what or whom is observed despite an internal narrative specifying a false correlation. This is an example of what can lead to stereotype threat. In other cases the internal narrative holds onto a belief which is completely counterfactual. This would be the difference between a man falling to peer pressure or a stereo type threat and playing basketball instead of going into music and a Mexican being a good person despite Trump\u0026rsquo;s lies about all Mexican\u0026rsquo;s being criminals.\n Damasio A (2011) The quest to understand consciousness.

It will likely become a book at some point.\n What is Programming About? #  Originally, computers were people hired by the government or other large business. They would do large numbers of potentially complicated computations by hand and file the results back and forth. \u0026ldquo;Programming\u0026rdquo; back then was figuring out how all of the work for a computation should be doled out to individuals or groups and how results from one group should be given to another group for further computation. Programming is mostly an operations problem involving the management of dependencies between parts of the problems and the communication of the results to other parts of the computation.\nAs technology evolved, there were several factors which converged to create computing as it is today. Logicians and mathematicians did a lot of leg work to develop the core concepts of representing ideas as numbers. People working in business communications wanted to make a lot of their work more efficient, so they developed techniques to use technology to transfer information quickly. People were attempting to solve large problems which couldn\u0026rsquo;t be solved by people within the time constraints allowed by war. This lead to a lot of developments which all converged under the pressure of war to create computers. Once the transistor was made and integrated circuits were perfected, the cost of computing went down drastically. Large businesses became locked into using computers because of the reduced cost. The cost was reduced because the computations could be done faster and fewer people (remember the \u0026ldquo;computers\u0026rdquo; of the past?) needed to be employed. Additionally, fewer tools needed to be purchased (although semiconductor companies were quite fond of pushing new tools every two years). As computers were mass produced and adopted at scale, the cost of the computers went down. Today, it is very difficult to find electronic devices which do not have at least a microcontroller in their circuits.\nThree Dimensions of Computation #  This means we can dissect programming and computing into three main dimensions:\n Arithmetic Logic Communication  These three dimensions have been used since the time of Sumeria, where they quite litterally tabulated information about business into clay tablets. They accounted for much of their government and business transactions. Today, the largest application of computing is still accounting. Most computers sit around doing nothing besides adding transactions, points, views, clicks, and coordinates.\nDespite thinking of Facebook as a communication platform, they are really an accounting and advertising platform. Facebook is quite simply a Sumerian pipe dream of recording and accounting as much as possible about our lives and interactions with businesses. Facebook tabulates each of the likes (and recently, other reactions, \u0026ldquo;love\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;care\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;haha\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sad\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;angry\u0026rdquo;) on posts and comments, building up a complete accounting of interactions on their platform. These bits are then used to profile you and match you with targeted advertising, then they are also archived and sent into \u0026ldquo;cold storage\u0026rdquo; where the permanance of the bits will never rival those markings on Sumerian clay tablets.\nCan you imgaine how awkward Facebook would be if, instead of being a software service, it was an actual Sumerian scribe following you around tabulating every reaction and message? They would have to go through your photo albums and memorize every face and point them out when you came across that person. They would take down messages and send them between you and your friend\u0026rsquo;s Sumerian scribes. They would also use the tabulated results of all you likes, reactions, message sentiments, and location to suggest businesses you might possibly want something from. Think about the cost and the overtime pay because of how often we\u0026rsquo;re on our phones using Facebook!\nOr can you imagine what it would be like to have to hire secretaries for everyone to organize and send messages like Slack or other similar chat applications allow us to do? It would sure make more jobs, but it would also make the service very expensive. This is the power of computers to make things cheaper by automating as much of the accounting as possible.\nOn the other hand, what Facebook does is still expensive. It has many costs from the sheer scale it operates at, some of those costs are ecological. For instance, in 2019, Facebook used 5,140,000 MWh of power. This is roughly 1/10th of the energy used by NYC in the same year. Additionally, it used used 2,731,000 cubic meter of water to cool down its data centers — this is approximately the same water usage as 1.7 NYC popuplations. Since this water is heated, it may increase the heat in whatever body of water it is released into. This is actually really bad for fish in rivers.\n Echoes in Games and Art #  Many of the games we\u0026rsquo;ve played through the ages are based on a type of rule based accounting. Eliminate pieces off a board by moving in certain ways (Chess and Checkers). Lay down a certain pattern of cards, which according to the rules, tabulate to a higher score (card games). Roll a higher number with the dice (most games of chance). Form the longest words with the most infrequent letters to get the highest score (Scrabble). Form the largest patches of area using black or white stones, with a lot of other rules dictating the protocol of the game (Go). Even if we were to come up with games of emotions, we might unconciously adapt the rules of golf to minimize the number of negative reactions one garners before rewarding people with the emotional response they want (we do have these games: comedy, storytelling, music, etc.).\nMany of the things we care about in our many cultures are all based on some form of math and logical thinking. In the games laid out above, we can see the three main areas of arithmetic, logic, and communication embodied. In a card game one has to add up the values of the cards, logically ensure they\u0026rsquo;ve followed the rules, and perhaps deduce the likelihood of other players having certain cards; the communication is embedded in the visibility of the cards and people\u0026rsquo;s facial expressions. In cooking we use a rough arithmetic of proportions, a logic of how and when the ingredients are added together, and communication of how to propagate the knowledge of those foods. The same could be said for music, weaving, and multitudes of other things.\nSummary of Programming #  To reiterate, programming is the art and science of managing the transfer of information over a vastly complex communications network between the peripherals, many forms of memory, and processing centers within each processor. Most data centers and large distributed systems have the complexity of galaxies of communications systems all tied together; and within those galaxies, multiple worlds of processors are all tied together. With all of today\u0026rsquo;s web applications we have, the complexity of the communications between the various components our distributed systems has become even more complex. In some ways, it\u0026rsquo;s a wonder we\u0026rsquo;ve even bothered building these complex behemoths. In other ways, it\u0026rsquo;s the obvious outcome of a culture bent on the \u0026ldquo;scientific management\u0026rdquo; method of maximizing profit and poductivity while minimizing cost through planning, scheduling, and standardization.\nThe Four Necessary Bases for the Emergence of Computers #  The necessary developments which lead to computers and programming mostly fell along four divisions:\nBusiness and Military Management\nWe started counting and started realizing the benefit of keeping symbols around as a proxy for the counted. Then we started managing the way things were built. Then we started managing how people worked. As a result of the pressures and converging technologies programming became the art of managing the computers. Nowdays, we even have arbitrary levels of managers to manage the computer managers (programmers).\nMathematics\nThis developed hand in hand with the business and military espects, but is interesting for the independence pure mathmatics obtained. At the core of programming today\u0026rsquo;s technological marvels is the concept of a symbol standing in for another symbol. Gödel, Church, Turing, and Hopper all pushed this a level further each. Gödel came up with a system of encoding logic using arithmetic and later a general system of recursive functions. Church built upon this creating a lambda calculus of computation. Turing built upon it creating a non-physical mechanical system that encoded logic and values in an infinite memory. Hopper realized that this could be extended to create a higher level language of certain values encoding for other values specific to the machine they were meant to operate on. This same principle became extended more and more until we could use math to display video mapped on a Cartesian coordinate system which was then mapped again back into a linear address space. This sort of though was extended until we could encode audio as binary digits. Then, in the 1980s, we discovered methods of compression which were necessary to make multimedia computing and the Internet work gicen the limited resources we had attained at the time.\nCommunications\nThe communications basis is separate from the physical basis because it evolved separately, until the concepts were merged together in the 1960s. The communications basis started with the telegraph, then teleprinting, then the telephone. As the telephone developed automatic ways of routing calls, the necessary concepts of digital addressing were developed.\nPhysical/Engineering\nThe physical basis of computing is intriguing, because we were building similar, yet limited, physical mechanisms since proabbly around 300BCE. While Babbage had an amazing idea with the analytical engine, the design was never finalized and correspondingly never built. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the electromechanical developments of the communications basis that we could transfer information to distances needed to fully implement computers which were powerful enough to be general purpose devices.\nBusiness and Military Management Basis #   5000 BCE — Sumerians start recording inventories, loans, taxes, business transactions, or even complaints. For a longer overview of logistics through the ages see Tepić, J., Tanackov, I., \u0026amp; Stojić, G. (2011). Ancient logistics–historical timeline and etymology. Tehnički vjesnik, 18(3), 379-384. 4000 BCE — Egyptians use various methods of planning and organizing labor. There is evidence of this also happening near the coast of Peru (irrigation canals of Zaña Valley, the Aspero complex in Peru). Unfortunately, what happened with in the central Andes of Peru is typically never figured into the history because of how imperial conquests typically go. 1721 — John Lombe\u0026rsquo;s water powered silk mill. 1765 — Europe starts using interchangeable parts again. This was a concept used before 200BCE, but it never really seems to have taken off except in times of war. 1766 — Matthew Bolton\u0026rsquo;s Soho Manufactory. 1776 — The Wealth of Nations lays out how division of labor is responsible for economic growth. This is most definitely not the first dicussion of division of labor, as it has been discussed in multiple locales since at least 1100 BC. This kind of thinking of single purpose laborers leads to thoughts about floor plan optimization, communication between distant parts of a business, and the shape of the human \u0026ldquo;computers\u0026rdquo; and their work follows from this thought. Even the layout of modern processors also follows from this thought. 1795 — Eli Terry Sr., my 3rd cousin 5x removed, invents a milling machine and begins making interchangeable parts for clocks along with an assembly line. He is resposible for making clocks affordable to the avarage person. As a side note, he was an anti-slavery abolitionist and his house had a secret room for runaway slaves. 1814 — Francis Cabot Lowell created the Boston Manufacturing Company which was the first vertically integrated manufacturing plant taking in raw materials and outputing final products. This became the Lowell System. 1830 — Antoine-Henri Jomini coined the French word logistique (rising from the French logis meaning lodgings) in his Précis de l\u0026rsquo;Art de la Guerre (Summary of the Art of War). His definition was \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; the art of well-ordering the functionings of an army, of well combining the order of troops in columns, the times of their departure, their itinerary, the means of communication necessary to assure their arrival at a named point \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. 1869 — U.S. Intercontinental Railroad completed. 1883 — Standard time zones are adopted by the railroads in order to synchronize schedules. 1904 — Harrington Emerson\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;betterment work\u0026rdquo; begins at Santa Fe Railway. Bonuses were introduced as positive feedback for good performance. Time studies were and an effort was made to ensure normal people would be used as to not set too high a bar for performance. Tools were standardized so that anyone could pick up a task and have the right tools. Improved methods of cost accounting were introduced. All work and tasks were assigned through a central board that displayed the status and assignments for everyone and everything. 1910-1915 — Henry Gantt invents the Gantt Chart. This is used in planning things during WWI. 1911 — Frederick Winslow Taylor published The Principles of Scienctific Management. His disciple, Charles Edward Knoeppel, also published Maximum production in machine-shop and foundry. 1912 — Lillian + Frank Gilbreth author A Primer of Scientific Management. 1914 — Lillian Gilbreth\u0026rsquo;s thesis is published: The Psychology of Management: the Function of the Mind in Determining, Teaching and Installing Methods of Least Waste. 1915 — Knoeppel publishes Installing efficiency methods. 1917-1919 — Knoeppel Publishes six volumes under the title Organization and administration. 1920s — Mary Parker Follett\u0026rsquo;s understanding of lateral processes within hierarchical orgs led to a matrix organization at DuPont. Charles Bedaux built on the work of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Charles Edward Knoeppel. 1921 — Lillian + Frank Gilbreth introduce flow process charts in \u0026ldquo;Process Charts, First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to Do Work\u0026rdquo;. 1922 — Leon P. Alford starts pushing systematic management. Later he works with Alexander Hamilton Church and some of there ideas were extensions of Charles Babbage\u0026rsquo;s thought. 1924 — Walter A. Shrewhart at Bell Labs invents the control chart. That same year or the next, W. Edwards Deming learns of this new method and takes it with him at the United States Department of Agriculture, United States Census Bureau, and eventually became a statistical consultant to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers during WWII. 1931 — Wassily Leontief moves from the Institute for the World Economy to the US National Bureau of Economic Research and during WWII served as a consultant to the US Office of Strategic Services. He developed Input-Output analysis, for which he earned the Nobel Prize in Economics. 1937 — Operations Research became an embryonic field as Great Britain geared up for WWII. 1939 — Leonid Kantorovich intruduces the concepts behind linear programming. Kantorovich, L.V. (1939). \u0026ldquo;Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production\u0026rdquo;. Management Science. 6 (4): 366–422. doi:10.1287/mnsc.6.4.366. JSTOR 2627082. 1949 — Wassily Leontief uses the Harvard Mark II to model the US economy based on various sectors of industry.  Mathematics Basis #   2700-2300 BCE — Sumerian abacus. They used a base 60 number system. 2000 — Babylonians and Egyptians have theorems about the sides of triangles (trigonometry). 300 BCE — Babylonians use one of their punctuation symbols as a zero-like placeholder. 200-100 BCE — Brahmi numerals are invented, becoming the basis of Indian and Hindu-Arabic numerals — they do not include zero. Pingala uses a concept of void, śūnya, in his writings on prosody as a placeholder for zero essentially creating a big-endian binary system. Zero as a plaeholder isn\u0026rsquo;t repeated until the Lokavibhāga in 458 CE. This same century, Hipparchus is using a placeholder for zero and making tables of chords, which actually means bowstring in the Greek, and these are the precursors to trigonometric functions. 40 BCE — Andronicus of Rhodes compiles Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s works on logic into six volumes of the Organon. Interestingly, Aristotle would call logic \u0026ldquo;analytics\u0026rdquo;. 36 BCE — Maya-Lenca associated civilizations already have zero as part of the long count calendar. They used a base 20 number system, and a few remaining cultures still use it. The concept spreads through the adjacent regions, but as far as we know it never spreads beyond the so-called \u0026ldquo;Americas\u0026rdquo;. The Tawantinsuyu (Inca) had an encoding for zero in their khipu by there being a missing knot in the corresponding position. It would be amazing to see what kinds of computation could have evolved out of this system, but it was cut short by colonization. Perhaps one day Indigenous people will continue developing our indigenous systems. They also had various mechanisms for calculation, see: Maya number system, Yupana, and Nepōhualtzintzin. 200 — Diophantus of Alexandria. 350-505 — Surya Siddhanta using similar methods to Hipparchus, the math of the heavens (jyotisha) are laid out in terms of the jya (bow-string). 499 — Aryabhatiya introduces sine, cos, and inverse sine (jya, koti-jya, utkrama-jya) as half angle half chord versions of those found in Surya Siddhanta. ~800 — Virasena calculate base 2,3, \u0026amp; 4 logarithms. 820 — Al-Khwārizmī writes Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wal-muqābala, or The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing. 1126 — Adelard of Bath translates Al-Khwārizmī\u0026rsquo;s works on Indian numbers as Dixit Algorizmi. 1145 — Robert of Chester translates Al-Khwārizmī\u0026rsquo;s book of \u0026ldquo;algebra\u0026rdquo; into Latin as Liber algebrae et almucabala. 1150 — Bhāskara II writes the Siddhānta Śiromani which lays out methods of trigonometry and calculus, but predated Newton and Leibniz. 1202 — Leonardo Fibonacci publishes Liber Abaci. It also included a well known sequence of numbers from the Arabic world which became known as the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence was known as early as 200 BC in Indian in the works of Pingala. 1530 — Yuktibhāṣā was a largely ignored treatise on math and astronomy in the Malayalam language. It laid out the methods of calculus, but predated Newton and Leibniz. 1614 — Napier lays out his idea for logarithms in Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio. 1637 — Both René Descartes + Pierre de Fermat develop methods of analytic geometry which extends the graphical methods laid out by Omar Khayyám, 11th centrury Persian mathematician, and likely Menaechmus, Greek mathematician 380-320 BCE. 1654 — Blaise Pascal + Pierre de Fermat founds the mathematical theory of probabilities. 1735 — Leohard Euler lays the foundations of graph theory 1799 — Carl Friedrich Gauss proves the fundamental theorem of algebra. 1843 — John Stuart Mill publishes A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive. 1847 — George Boole introduces an immature version of his system of logic. 1854 — George Boole publishes An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities. 1874 — Georg Cantor starts laying the foundation of Set Theory. 1889 — Giuseppe Peano publishes \u0026ldquo;Arithmetices principia: nova methodo exposito\u0026rdquo; which lays out the Peano Axioms. 1891 — Cantor lays out his diagonal argument 1928 — David Hilbert reformulates his earlier problem of proving the consistency of the Peano Axioms into three parts: 1) Is mathematics complete? 2) Is mathematics consistent? 3) Is mathematics decidable?

Delagates included Mary K. Hawes, Grace Hopper, Jean Sammet, and Saul Gorn. Also see Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s Timeline of Mathematics. Also see Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s Timeline of Programming Languages.  Communications Basis #   1826-1830 — Joseph Henry does the leg work which leads to the electromechanical relay and the telegraph. 1831-1833 — Carl Friedrich Gauss + Wilhelm Eduard Weber work on electromagnetic theory and build a telegraph in 1833. Two units of magnetic flux are named after them. 1832 — Pavel Schilling demonstrates his needle telegraph. That same year Charles Wheatstone lectures on this same idea telling people that it was already technically possible to build a telegraph. Samuel Morse meets Charles Thomas Jackson and the two discuss Jackson\u0026rsquo;s electromagnet. 1836 — William Cooke takes interest in the telegraph in Europe. 1837 — Cooke + Wheatstone demostrate a telegraph over a distance of 1.5 mi. 1838 — Morse, Gale (a personal friend of Joseph Henry), + Alfred Vail develop Morse code and build a telegraph using electromechanical relays to increase the distance served to 10 mi. There was a public demonstration at Speedwell Ironworks in New Jersey and they transmitted the message \u0026ldquo;A patient waiter is no loser\u0026rdquo;. 1840 — Wheatstone patents his \u0026ldquo;Wheatstone ABC Instrument\u0026rdquo;. 1841 — Alexander Bain creates the first teleprinter, followed Royal Earl House in 1846, + David Edward Hughes in 1855. 1844 — Morse demonstrates the message \u0026ldquo;What hath God wrought.\u0026rdquo; He sent it 38 miles from Supreme Court Chamber in the US Capitol basement to Mount Claire Station in Blatimore Maryland. 1845 — Wheatstone + Cooke register the Electric Telegraph Company. 1863 — Edward A. Calahan invents the stock ticker. 1864-1866 — Wheatstone advises the Atlantic Telegraph Company\u0026rsquo;s Atlantic Cables. 1870 — Telegraph systems in the UK are placed government control. Émile Baudot invents his 5 bit code. The baud, or the unit of symbol transmission, is named in honor of him. 1874 — Western Union\u0026rsquo;s President William Orton proclaims the telegraph was \u0026ldquo;the nervous system of commerce\u0026rdquo;. Alexander Graham Bell meets with John Henry to discuss his idea. Henry encourages Bell and tells him to get the knowledge he needs. Later, Bell meets Thomas A. Watson and the two begin to work together. 1876 — \u0026ldquo;Mr. Watson come here — I want to see you.\u0026rdquo; Later that year they demonstrated a two-way call over 2.5 mi between Cambridge and Boston. 1877 — Bell Telephone Company. 1888 — Almon Brown Stroger develops the first commeercially succesful stepping switch, or uniselector. 1891 — Stroger patents the the rotary dial.

Then more clocks start to show up. This is merely 128 years after Fibonacci reintroduced mathematics from the Arab world. How odd would it be if those mathematic pricinples were the only ideas which had diffused from the Arab world into the Latin and English speaking world? 1642 — Blaise Pascal creates a mechanical calculator called the Pascaline. 1672-1694 — Inspired by Pascal, Gottfried Wilhem Leibniz constructs a stepped reckoner, but the gearwork couldn\u0026rsquo;t be fabricated properly. 1725 — Basile Bouchon partially automates part of weaving by using perforated paper tape. 1804 — Joseph Marie Jacquard fully automated weaving with punched cards. 1820 — Thomas de Colmar patents the Arithmomètre. 1822 — Charles Babbage creates the difference engine. 1827 — Georg Ohm develops his law relating current, voltage, and resistance. 1833 — Ada Lovelace meets Charles Babbage. 1843 — Ada Lovelace translates Luigi Frederico Menabrea\u0026rsquo;s description of Charles Babage\u0026rsquo;s presentation, but she adds extensive annotations and an appendix with what is arguably the first algorithm for calculating the Bernoulli Numbers. The program was essentially written in machine language. As for the engine itself, it was never fully built. Only its predecessor, the difference engine was fully built in 1990. 1854 — Gustav Kirchoff generalizes Ohm\u0026rsquo;s law. 1872 — Sir William Thompson makes a tide-predicting machine using pulleys and wires. 1884 — Herman Hollerith uses punched cards to assist tabulation.

The Evolution of Programming #  In the beginning, programming a machine was task full of tedium. One had to:\n Be intimately familiar with the hardware being used. Analyze the scope of the computation. Divide the computation into stages which can be performed on the hardware. Plant out the logic and arithmetic of each task and how memory would be utilized. Translate that logic, arithmetic, and storage instructions into machine code. Input that code into the machine using an interface specific to each machine (wires, switches, punch cards, etc.). Read out and record the output of the computation.  Later, assemblers were invented that let people use architecture specific mnemonics called assembly language instead of binary, octal, or hexadecimal. In time, people like Grace Hopper came along and — in addition to removing physical bugs from the hardware — they created higher level languages. These were unique in several ways. One, they didn\u0026rsquo;t require complete knowledge of the hardware. Two, while they still required some memory management, they could plan out memory address offsets and register usage automatically. Three, you could write a program on one machine architecture and it was likely that if the language became avalable on another machine architecture, it would still compile.\nThe next big evolution in programming was dynamic memory management. This meant a programmer no longer had to specifically plan out memory usage (in theory), but the language itself would plan out how and when to allocate and release memory. There was typically a reference counter for variables and when the reference count reached zero the memory would be released. This evolved into more advanced forms of garbage collection. Unfortunately, there were some unfortunate side effects. Sometimes people could write code which cause a rerference to stick around beyond its actual use, this lead to memory leaks. Also, in certain cases the garbage collector would cause some pretty awful hickups when it decided it was time to clean up during a critical moment. There are work-arounds, but they typically mean hacking the language into letting one plan out memory allocation manually.\nThere are a lot of patterns which have emerged over the decades, and there are many books written about them. A modicum of the patterns have libraries or frameworks which support them. Many of them don\u0026rsquo;t, which means that programmers must build their own libraries or frameworks for many patterns.\nBy default, many programming languages support a text based environment because of the historical backwards compatiblility of only having a text based interface. When programs entered the world of visual interfaces, all of the graphics had to be drawn by the program, there was no library for visual interfaces. A program\u0026rsquo;s graphics engine wrote directly to the video buffer (or virtual buffer, which was synchronously copied to the video buffer at the refresh rate to minimize visual artifacts). As graphical shells and operating systems like Windows, OS/2, and Mac OS became popular, programs would use a kind of object oriented approach to specify every aspect of the user interface in code. Every visual element on the screen would have multiple objects associated with them. Many properties had to be filled in programmatically in an imperative style. Messages would be dispatched to worker threads through a central dispatcher (a WindowProc in Windows). If a program needed a layout to resize as the window changed, all of the code for that behavior had to be manually written. Much code with different concerns was all grouped together around the associated objects. This started changing when Sun Microsystems released Java with its Abstract Windowing Toolkit and became easier with Swing. Along with those layout engines, the standards starting to brew around HTML + CSS started to make declarative UIs very appealing. many of those declarative approaches allow separating concerns around prsentation, content, and certain animations. Today, many application UI frameworks include an option for declaratively defining a UI layout because it has be come a best practice, even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go far enough as an organizing principle.\nProgramming is Stuck #  Fundamentally, nothing about programming interfaces has changed since 1997. Data exchange (or data binding, if you prefer) remains an issue; though it seems like a few patterns are being settled on, it is really a rehash of similar concepts from the 90\u0026rsquo;s. Organizing code around UI and UX is still an issue. Making sure code is organized around various independent orthogonal issues seems to be a challenge. Most languages still place the burden on the programmer to manage where data is and how it is transferred around the system. Certain patterns have made many of these issues easier to solve. However, we still keep repeating ourselves over and over and reinventing the same wheel someone else invented in the 70s through 90s. Sometimes we get actual progress, and it\u0026rsquo;s quite welcome.\nWe have an acronym to remind us not to do this: DRY, Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself. It is the maxim most programmers live by. It is why we build standard libraries, garbage collectors, frameworks, reusable bits of code, isomorphic coding, and many other things. However, there are certain things that always seem to need to be repeated with a few changes each time we add a new screen or form to an application. Things do not wire themselves into finished products.\n  XKCD: \u0026#34;StackSort connects to StackOverflow, searches for \u0026#39;sort a list\u0026#39;, and downloads and runs code snippets until the list is sorted.\u0026#34;    Next\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/nkp/analyze-sota/','title':"Analyzing the State of the Art",'content':" This is a work in progress. It will likely become a book at some point.\n Analyzing the State of the Art #  With todays applications, there is typically a focus on serving large numbers of people across multiple platforms. This is complicated by those various platforms requiring different languages and technologies in order to implement each part. Many languages have been focused on incremental improvements over previous languages. This is also the case for many web technologies.\nWe have a wide variety of languages which can be used on the server side. In fact, our choice on the server side is nearly unlimited and is only constrained by convenience or special needs. Clients can be written in many different languages, especially given the rise of transpilers. Generally, browser based apps are constrained to languages which readily allow usage of JavaScript libraries. Client apps on iOS are limited Objective C, Swift, and other languages which transpile to Javascipt running in a web view. Android apps are limited to languages which run in the JVM, languages with a C interface which can be called from within the JVM, and languages which transpile to JavaScript running in a web view. + In the recent few years, web apps have started to mature in their approach to using components, data binding, and approaches to manipulating the DOM. Methods like Relay and GraphQL have also simplified the serialization of data for views. Other technologies like flat buffers on ArrayBuffers, service workers, and HTTP/2 have allowed speeding up the tranfer of data.\nDespite all of these improvements, web application development is still not too far removed from where it was in the beginning when JavaScript and VBScript were just taking off in browsers. Programming is still stuck in low level thought, while apps are much broader in scope. Our languages and tools have not kept up with the complexity of what we try to accomplish. Most of our programming languages are still systems programming laguages leaving us to repeat oursleves over and over again.\nDuplication in Architecture #  Let\u0026rsquo;s analyze a relative simple web application that could be something from real life. Each of the components may be physically duplicates and load balanced. We have a system composed of:\n Websever which serves front end code. Backend API service proxied through the webserver. Database which holds all the data for the system. Service which collects and aggregates statistics from the system in Redis. Redis keystore which stores the online aggregation of data and also stores the session data in another database.  We can see a lot duplication which should be examined in order to determine if there are any opportunities for reducing complexity. The first set of duplicates to bring attention to are the aspects of data modeling and validation.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s actually a decent level of complexity going on here which needs to be appreciated. Several other systems (not included here) likely interact with the backend service. In many systems around today, there is likely an additional service worker which handles longer running tasks. I\u0026rsquo;m omitting all of that, just to focus on the core of the problem.\n   mermaid.initialize({ flowchart: { useMaxWidth:true } });  sequenceDiagram autonumber participant A as Alice participant B as Browser participant WS as Web Server participant API participant S as Service participant DB participant R as Redis A - B: Navigates to site B - WS: Initial Request activate WS WS -- B: Returns Frontend (FE) to Browser deactivate WS B - WS: Auth check activate WS WS - API: Auth check (cont.) activate API API - R: Retrieve session data activate R R -- API: Session data deactivate R API -- WS: Return session, if exists deactivate API WS -- B: Session (cont.) deactivate WS B - WS: Asset request activate WS B - WS: Asset request WS -- B: Return asset WS -- B: Return asset deactivate WS B - A: Sees the UI A - B: Requests with UI B - WS: FE requests from API activate WS WS - API: Webserver proxies to API activate API API - DB: API requests data from DB activate DB DB -- API: DB returns data to API deactivate DB API -- WS: API proxies through webserver deactivate API WS -- B: FE receives the data from the API deactivate WS B -- A: Sees update A - B: Requests with UI B - WS: FE requests from API activate WS WS - API: Webserver proxies to API activate API API - S: API requests data from S activate S S - R: S requests data from Redis activate R R -- S: Redis returns data to Service deactivate R S -- API: Returns data to API deactivate S API -- WS: API proxies through webserver deactivate API WS -- B: FE receives the data from the API deactivate WS B -- A: Sees update With this diagram and the one above, we can begin to see the complexity of serializing, marshalling, and validating data and how it relates to the duplication of the data models across multiple systems.  Duplication I: Data Definitions, Validations, and Serialization #  In this example let\u0026rsquo;s assume the API is written in Ada, the FE is written in JavaScript, the Service is written in C++, and the database schema is in a MySQL dialect. This means that we have duplication of:\n the type specifications in four different languages. validation constraints in four different laguages. serialization of these models in three different languages (the DB already has a serialization format built in, but I\u0026rsquo;m not counting it since we don\u0026rsquo;t have to specify it or manually wire it).  Let\u0026rsquo;s take an overview of each of these. First, there\u0026rsquo;s the SQL definition of the table. There\u0026rsquo;s a few things we need to notice about this. It uses the database\u0026rsquo;s built-in types. It specifies ranges on the length of certain fields. Curiously, besides basic type safety, it provides no actual verification of the data for patterns. If there was an EMAIL type in SQDL\u0026rsquo;s DDL, it would be able to validate the form of the email address according to the RFC. Having the database perform all the validation would be less than ideal given the latency in verifying the form of the data by going through at least two network connections, with one potentially having less than ideal properties. Additionally, since databases often do not have the same data types as programming languages, most stored values are converted into their actual types. This is especially common now with noSQL document stores. This means that validation is especially a bad match for DBs.\n-- Using types provided by the database which may be different than the types -- provided by other languages.

Most of us only have one culture and we are typically blind to how it shapes our thoughts and feelings. Culture is one of the filters through which we see the world. It is one of the deepest ways we make sense of the world rooted in our experiences and intergenerational ways of thinking. Culture shapes how language is understood. Culture shapes what actions are considered acceptible. Culture forms how we relate to every other entity in the universe.\nMany definitions of culture do not seem to have the necessary depth to fully address the phenomenon. They look at very specific manifestations of culture and mistake those check lists as culture in and of itself. This leads to many issues and misunderstandings which will be addresssed later in this work. Here are some definitions according the the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster:\nThe arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively (OED).  The customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or other social group (OED).  The customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group. Also: The characteristic features of everyday existence (such as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time (MW).  The integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior that depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations (MW).  Lets examine a list of academic definitions since 1949. Notice how they change over time. Some of the definitions agree with the dictionary definitions above, but as we approach definitions from the 90s they move more towards a more comprehensive understanding of the core process. Each of these definitions focuses on a particular aspect of culture.\nCulture\u0026hellip;consists in those patterns relative to behavior and the products of human action which may be inherited, that is, passed on from generation to generation independently of the biological genes. — Parson, T. (1949). Essays in Sociological Theory. p 8. Glencoe, IL.  Culture consists of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievements of human groups, including their embodiments in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of traditional (i.e. historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values; culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of action, and on the other as conditioning elements of further action. — Kroeber, A.L., \u0026amp; Kluckhohn, C. (1952). Culture: A critical review of concepts and definitions. Harvard University Peabody Museum of American Archeology and Ethnology Papers 47.  Culture is the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one category of people from another. — Hofstede, G. (1984). National cultures and corporate cultures. In L.A. Samovar \u0026amp; R.E. Porter (Eds.), Communication Between Cultures. p 52. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.  Culture: learned and shared human patterns or models for living; day- to-day living patterns. these patterns and models pervade all aspects of human social interaction. Culture is mankind\u0026rsquo;s primary adaptive mechanism. — Damen, L. (1987). Culture Learning: The Fifth Dimension on the Language Classroom. p 367. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.  Culture is the shared knowledge and schemes created by a set of people for perceiving, interpreting, expressing, and responding to the social realities around them. — Lederach, J.P. (1995). Preparing for peace: Conflict transformation across cultures. p 9. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press.  These definitions seem to move from pure material culture and acheivement to the last definition which appears to be all encompassing, but I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s missing a particular aspect which we have no word for in English. The closest I can come to defining it is a set of reference frames which reify reality and which are key to survival within the hyperspace created through both the environment and ways of relating to one another.\nIn some cases, the definition of culture could parallel the meaning that is used in regards to cultures of bacteria, molds, or fungi. It is something that has a distinct life as a collective which engenders specific internal conditions within individual organisms. Those internal conditions are dependent on the continuation and reproduction of the specific culture over time. The culture will evolve and change over time, but there will likely a distinct core of it. In some cases there may be an apparent discontinuity due to extreme circumstances (disease, foreign invasions, colonization, etc.).\nAn example of this process in daily life would be a Wabanaki child learning basket making. The opportunity of the time together with elders facilitates the transfer of multiple modes of information. The elder may show the youth examples of their work and share culturally relevant stories about the materials they use. Particularly, the stories of how humans came to be by Gluskabe splitting and ash tree in two with an arrow and the story of sweetgrass. After learning the symbology behind the materials, the youth will learn the techniques. Built into the techniques is another layer of cultural knowledge reproduction, the youth are taught the specific patterns for how to weave culturally relevant symbology.\nIn yet another case, a young child learns the ways their parents and kin relate to other people with specific features. In this case, the mechanism is based on tracking attention and emotional state of people to whom the child is attached in response to other people in the environment. This can lead to a rudimentary embodied racism. Later on in the child\u0026rsquo;s life, they may be exposed to more complicated cultural motifs and ideas around racism as their ideology around racism is codified. These children then go on to reproduce racist culture. If the closest people in the child\u0026rsquo;s life are open minded and welcoming, it can lead a rudimentary openess and welcomeness in the child. Even with this rudimentary openess, it takes experience and practice for people to remain comfortable with differences in culture and appearance. These people can at least be decent human beings when their cultures are in conflict.\nThese example situations show how culture perpetuates itself. It also shows how changes to the internal state of the organism (human) are accomplished which allows a culture to then propagate itself through the generations. It requires a high level of closeness (attachment), attention, and cooperation over long periods of time to successfully propagate. Once it is propagated it forms the basis of how older children efficiently interact with the rest of the memebers of the culture.\nTOC #    Perceptual \u0026#43; Narrative Zones   Each individual (an agent) has their own perceptual zone which differs from other people\u0026#39;s perceptual zones. The perceptual zones may overlap, but in many case they don\u0026#39;t. The perceptual zone is the combined whole of experience each individual is perceiving and sense-making at any given time.

The experiences have ranged from electronics and math, to building a simple computer out of logic gates when I was 11, to programming professionally since 2009 when I was 25. I hope you find everything in here to be enlightening.\nThis is dedicated to my parents. They made many sacrifices for me to have these experiences.\nForeward #  The very first computer I touched was the Commodore 64. I was still crawling around in my diapers, but was incredibly intrigued by this device which held my brother so wrapt in the glow of the monitor. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize its prompt was actually a BASIC interpreter until I started learning programming 9 years later. In the course of the intervening time, I spent more than my fair share of time playing Frogger — trying to jump across logs and traffic and inevitably getting squished by traffic.\nThe Commodore 64 was my first computer. The \u0026quot;64\u0026quot; stood for an incredible 64k of ram and it cost about $600 is the 1980\u0026#39;s.\nWhat was your first computer/gaming device? pic.twitter.com/sY1M9TpeKp\n\u0026mdash; NatoJenkins (@NatoJenkins) May 20, 2020  My parents and I were walking though the mall and my dad saw this Packard Bell 316SX with a 16MHz 386 processor. I could tell it was an important juncture in our life by how my parents talked about it. My mom saw the price tag and immediately protested how expensive it was. I vaguely remember my father reassuring my mom that we had the money — though in all honesty we probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have bought it. We moved the van around to loading dock, loaded the box into the van, and then unloaded the house. It had a whole stack of 3.5\u0026quot; — not too floppy — floppy disks to install both MS DOS \u0026amp; MS Windows 3.1. I remember sitting in anticipation with my dada waiting for every single bit of data on those disks to copy over to the hard drive and get inflated. After we finally installed Windows, we typed win and watched this amazing graphical logo pop up as Windows 3.1 started up. The first thing my dad did was start up Minesweeper and Solitaire. It was late and and bedtime. Installing MS Office had to wait until the next evening.\nA Packard Bell Legend 316SX! I love this series of Packard Bell desktops, they were my first PC. This one is a little earlier, a 16mhz 386 pic.twitter.com/8TkNObsK1k\n\u0026mdash; foone (@Foone) September 14, 2017  It was around this time that my dad started teaching my about electronics. We built some simple circuits which made LEDs blink in various orders. We made timer circuits. We ever made an electronic \u0026ldquo;organ\u0026rdquo;, but playing it involved a jumper wire and dealing with the differences in sound quality caused by using different types of capacitors. After that, I started learning digital electronics and got interested in Boolean logic.\nIt was also around this time that I discovered some of the more technical entries in the Encylclopaedia Brittanica, like Optimization Theory, Game Theory, Magneto Hydrodynamics, and General Relativity. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand the equations and the way the section on Calculus was written didn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense to me yet since I hadn\u0026rsquo;t studied algebra yet (and it was the Encyclopaedia Brittanica where understanding the technical subjects requires first understanding the technical subjects.). I had no way of learning these things when I was 7, but yet I\u0026rsquo;d stare at them devotedly from time to time as though they were sacred, mystical inscriptions. This ended up ruining my scholarly endeavors in high school, because I would gain access to the internet and find MIT\u0026rsquo;s online class materials for calculus and vector calculus. Eventually, I borrowed my music teacher\u0026rsquo;s book on differential equations and, while I didn\u0026rsquo;t study the prereqs enough to solve the problems in the book, I grasped it conceptually.\nOne of the most interesting things we had, besides the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, my dad\u0026rsquo;s old medical texts, and his electronics books, was a book called \u0026ldquo;DOS for Dummies.\u0026rdquo; It was something we bought sometime after we got the computer. I worked my way through that book when I was 8 years old. After working through that, I found the MS DOS 5.0 manual and proceeded to work through it. I learned about batch scripting and learned how to modify our CONFIG.SYSand AUTOEXEC.BAT. Then the qbasic command caught my eye around the time I turned 9. The MS DOS manual was incredibly vague about it. It mentioned looking at the on-line help and left it at that (this was before I knew about the Internet and the internet was definitely not required). With slight hesitation, I typed in the command unsure of what it could do to the system. A blue screen came up and announced Welcome to MS-DOS QBasic.\nAfter realizing how extensive the \u0026ldquo;Survival Guide\u0026rdquo; was and learning to program, I realized there was so much more to read through. There was online help for MS Office and while reading through that, I came across this thing called Visual Basic for Applications. I was intrigued by being able to write applications that executed in an Excel worksheet. Eventually we got another computer with Windows 95 and a Cyrix 6x86 processor. When we would frequent the book stores at the mall, I started reading various books on programming. I started reading through books on C, C++, and other books like \u0026ldquo;Tricks of the Game-Programming Gurus\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Upgrading and Repairing PCs\u0026rdquo;. Then I moved onto magazines like Dr. Dobb\u0026rsquo;s and Visual Basic Programmer Journal. I never had a compiler and the only assembler I had was debug which was much more of a diassembler, but it did let me write a few simple assembly programs. So I stuck to Visual Basic for Applications and writing C++ programs on paper.\nThings changed when web development started be a thing. There were even magazines about it. One magazine was this oversized quarterly with a CD-ROM. That\u0026rsquo;s how I first learned HTML + CSS in 1996. I also found out that I could program the browser in VBScript, but quickly found out that JavaScript was the up and coming language. When my parents would go shopping at Price Club (before it was CostCo), I\u0026rsquo;d go over to the computers and play around with the browsers and see what kinds of interesting things I could code up while my parents were shopping.\nSome of you might be looking at me, squinting, wanting to ask, \u0026ldquo;Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t you do that at home?\u0026rdquo; The version of Internet Explorer we had was too old and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I figured out how to get a Internet Explorer 4 installation CD that I was abe to mess around with other things, like tables and JavaScript. We still didn\u0026rsquo;t have the internet, so I had to make do with a version of MS IIS that I found to be able to host my own local site.\nEventually, I got a book on C++ that included a crippled version of MS Visual C++, but I was never really able to master Windows programming in C++ because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have all of the requisite knowledge and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford books on it. I probably could have taken copius notes at the bookstore, but I had gotten in trouble at one of the bookstores before for taking notes like that. Things changed when I found out about Java and found ways to download it at my parents friends houses so that I could install it on my computer at home. I learned it from the docs and a couple of articles from Dr. Dobb\u0026rsquo;s. I started building UIs in Java and realized that it was a lot more verbose compared to building web applications with HTML or building apps with Visual Basic and its form editor.\nIn junior high, I was the most knowledgeable on computers.I \u0026ldquo;volunteered\u0026rdquo; to set up the computer labs. At the time I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind doing those things for free, because I also had no idea how much my skills were worth. I high school, after working on the farm for a few months, I managed to get a job helping out setting up new computerlabs in the dorms and upgrading our old computer lab in the main building. Because of that interest, our music teacher set up a coputer club and, in that club, I learned about Linux and how to set up a webserver on it. I college, my friends and I would come up with an idea to host a show on the computer network. We would come up topics for \u0026ldquo;The Show\u0026rdquo; (yes, it was that good) and film it. I would make the website, edit some of the audio, make title screens, and serve the show from my computer in my dorm room. This was all in 2004, one year before YouTube.\nAfter college, I\u0026rsquo;d set up a system to help livestream the audio of my friend\u0026rsquo;s restuarant\u0026rsquo;s music shows. I also ended up building him a Point of Sale system which I think he still uses. Then I got involved with a start-up which only paid me $200/mo at most while I was living out of a friend\u0026rsquo;s house surviving off food stamps and generosity. That pattern continued until 2012, while I was starting to learn to navigate the business and tech worlds. Eventually, I \u0026ldquo;made it\u0026rdquo; by getting the jobs currently in my resume.\nOver the course of all that time, I learned PHP, C#, Python, Ruby, Ada, Coffee Script, Clojure, Objective C, Scala, Haskell, Go, and I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at a lot of other languages. I keep seeing the same patterns creep up all the time. We keep repeating ourselves over and over again. Though I\u0026rsquo;ve faltered a few times, my goal is eventually make sure the only programming I ever have to do is write new code that does something that has never been done before. Perhaps it is unreachable. It is probably up there, in terms of lofty goals eventually excluded from possibility, with the complete axiometization of all mathematics by Russell and Whitehead.\nTOC #    What is Programming About?

Olympus will find the name \u0026ldquo;Sun-a-do\u0026rdquo;. If you look up the Wikipedia articles on Mt. Olympus and the Olympic Mountains, it will tell you so. Unfortunately, that is not really the name. Those articles take an old, potentially unreliable, yet official looking source, and use it to justify their claims that \u0026ldquo;The local Native American name for the peak is Sunh-a-do\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The mountains were originally called \u0026ldquo;Sun-a-do\u0026rdquo; by the Duwamish Indians\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. However, let\u0026rsquo;s analyze what is claimed and what can actually be substantiated with their citation.\nThe favorite citation for people wanting to justify the \u0026ldquo;Sun-a-do\u0026rdquo; name is Edmond Meany\u0026rsquo;s 1923 publication \u0026ldquo;Origin of Washington Geographic names.\u0026rdquo; The Wikipedia article uses this as it\u0026rsquo;s sole justification. Looking at the provided evidence leaves much to be desired:\n \u0026ldquo;(The Canoe and the Saddle, John H. Williams Edition, pages 23-24.) Later, on page 278, he declares that the Victoria Indians called the Olympian Mountains \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rsquo;ngazanelf.\u0026rdquo; J. A. Costello says the Duwamish Indians used the name \u0026ldquo;Sun-a-do.\u0026rdquo; (The Siwash, Seattle, 1895.)\u0026rdquo;\n This appears to cite Costello 1895, but that work contains no reference to the name \u0026ldquo;sun-a-do\u0026rdquo;. Unless it was personal communication with Costello, this is bogus. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a furtive kernel of truth in this low fidelity recording of a word. Many other notations of the names of places in various Native languages are equally egregious, but after analyzing the languages representative in an area one can peice together a likely origin. Many of the sounds on the Salish Sea are not found in Spanish, French, or English, so it\u0026rsquo;s understandable that people would struggle to write down words using only a Latin alphabet.\nNo one seems to bother with the other name recorded here, \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rsquo;ngazanelf\u0026rdquo; (Withrop \u0026amp; Heavey 1913). It doesn\u0026rsquo;t match up well with any modern written othography, but seems to at least make a more concerted effort to record speach with some fidelity. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to take a look at language found in an area to try to peice together a possible origin.\nThe words for mountain in the language area are:\n Halq\u0026rsquo;eméylemqel [χalq\u0026rsquo;eme:ilemqel] / Halkomelem language  smá:lt — \u0026lsquo;stone, rock (any size), mountain\u0026rsquo; (FirstVoices, Galloway 2009)   Northern dxʷləšúcid [dxʷləʃútsid] / Tulalip Lushootseed (TulalipLushootseed)  sbadil — \u0026lsquo;mountain\u0026rsquo; (TulalipMountain)   Southern dxʷləšúcid [dxʷləʃútsid] / Nisqually Lushootseed (TulalipLushootseed)  skʷatač [skʷatətʃ] — \u0026lsquo;mountain\u0026rsquo; (Zahir 2018)   Lhéchalosem [ɬətʃəlɔsəm] / Nooksack  smanit — \u0026lsquo;mountain\u0026rsquo; (Nooksack1)   Straights Salish Group  XWLEMI\u0026rsquo;CHOSEN [xʷləmiʔčósən/xʷləmiʔtʃɔsən] / Lummi  sŋgánt — \u0026lsquo;any rock, stone, mountain\u0026rsquo; (Gibbs 1863)   Xws7ámeshqen [xʷsʔámešqen/xʷsʔámeʃqen] / Samish  sŋgá:nt — \u0026lsquo;rock, mountain\u0026rsquo;; sts’áts’e e te sngánet \u0026lsquo;On top of the mountain\u0026rsquo; (Samish1, Samish2)   SENĆOŦEN [sənčaθən/səntʃɔθən] / Saanich  SṈÁNET [sŋénət] — \u0026lsquo;any rock, stone, mountain\u0026rsquo; (SannichNature)   nəxʷsƛ̕ay̕əmúcən [nəxʷsʔtɬʼaiəmɔtsən] / Klallam  sŋánt — \u0026lsquo;any rock, stone\u0026rsquo;, sx̣əy̕kʷəy̕éʔč [χeikʷəiéʔtʃ] \u0026lsquo;mountain, from backbone [or ribcage]\u0026rsquo; (KlallamNature, KWOTD1, KWOTD2, KWOTD3)     ƛ̕əxʷəlməš [ʔtɬʼəχʷəlməʃ] / Lower Chehalis  sma:nəč [sma:nətʃ] — \u0026lsquo;mountain\u0026rsquo; (Snow 1969)   sƛ̕əpúlmx [sʔtɬʼəpəlmx] / Cowlitz  sá:kʷ or nšsá:kʷ — \u0026lsquo;Mt St Helens\u0026rsquo; (Kincade 1997) [might mean \u0026ldquo;mountain\u0026rdquo;, but need dictionary or elder to confirm]    Given the grammar, it\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible that \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rsquo;ngazanelf\u0026rdquo; is something like sŋgaŋgá:nt, meaning \u0026ldquo;mountains\u0026rdquo; (Frachtenberg 1917). Given the similarity of the languages of SENĆOŦEN and nəxʷsƛ̕ay̕əmúcən, it could be using the durative ending |-əɬ| (Montler 1986). This would form sŋgaŋgá:ntəɬ, meaning \u0026lsquo;Those are mountains\u0026rsquo;. If my grammar is wrong (and it likely is), then the -t- at the end might be dropped with the durative ending. Then, \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rsquo;ngazanelf\u0026rdquo; is actually not a half-hearted representation of the sounds of sŋgaŋgá:nəɬ.\nWe can imagine those past interactions between explorer and Klallam unfolding this way:\n Explorer asks \u0026ldquo;What are those called?\u0026rdquo;\nKlallam person (being helpful, thinking maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t have those were they come from) replies \u0026ldquo;sŋgaŋgá:nəɬ (Those are mountains).\u0026rdquo;\nExplorer, thinking that\u0026rsquo;s the proper name, writes down what he can make of the phrase and fastidiously writes \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rsquo;ngazanelf\u0026rdquo; unaware that could apply to any group of mountains.\n Embeded in these interactions are assumptions: Everything has an exact name and everything must be named. Also, communication between the two languages has zero impedance and that each person\u0026rsquo;s conceptualization of the world is identitical. These cannot be assumptions because even if two people speak the same language impedance can be high and no two people have the same conceptualization of the world. Of course, people can always say it was just a misunderstanding. Maybe it was, but if people wanted to know more than quick answers to misunderstood questions by proxy of translation, they could have learned the language.\nWhat about \u0026ldquo;sun-a-do\u0026rdquo;? If one squints at the sounds just right, \u0026ldquo;sun-a-do\u0026rdquo; sounds kind of like a terrible representation of how mountain, sŋánt, is said in nəxʷsƛ̕ay̕əmúcən. When listening to the recording of the word, we can hear the first two pairs of morphemes match up well (sŋ ~ sun, án ~ a), but the last two do not (t ~ do). But what does the original source say about \u0026ldquo;sun-a-do\u0026rdquo;? It says that it is Duwamish. However, we have clear linguistic evidence this classification is also wrong. It is not Duwamish (a Lushootseed language), it is nəxʷsƛ̕ay̕əmúcən [nəxʷsʔtɬʼaiəmɔtsən] / Klallam.\nThis shows the ignorance these colonizers had. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother to know which language a word was in. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother to find out if the mountains were on traditional territory of the people they were asking or if the mountains were even important to them. They most definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to even ask about the conceptualiztion of what a mountain was to Native people.\nIt is worth noting there are also very specific names for the two ranges of mountains within the Klallam territory:\n mímxʷtən \u0026lsquo;Elwha River Range: Griff Peak, Unicorn Horn, Unicorn Peak (looks like a reclining lady)\u0026rsquo; (KlallamPlaces) ʔáʔašit \u0026lsquo;Olympic mountains south of Crescent Bay and Port Angeles.\u0026rsquo; (KWOTD4) [Baldy Ridge, including Mount Storm King \u0026amp; Mount Baldy]  In spite of only finding out that most people just called them \u0026ldquo;rocks\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;mountains\u0026rdquo;, the Quileute do have a name for the Olympics. This is no surprise, since they are considered part of their traditional territory. They call them:\n t́ist́iláalati - \u0026ldquo;Thunderbird\u0026rsquo;s Lair\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;place of Thunderbird\u0026rdquo;\n The reference specifically calls it The Blue Glacier (Powell \u0026amp; Penn 1972), but it\u0026rsquo;s acutally the name for the whole region and the subterranian region beneath the snow cap/glacier (Wray 2013). This isn\u0026rsquo;t the only mountain in the PNW named this way. In Canada, the Squamish Nation (Sk̲wx̲wú7mesh Úxumixw [skʷχʷoʔmeʃ oχomiχʷ]) call Black Tusk mountain t\u0026rsquo;ak\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rsquo;ak mu\u0026rsquo;yin t\u0026rsquo;la in7inyaxa7en [tʼakʼtʼak muʔjin t\u0026rsquo;la inʔinjáχaʔen] or \u0026ldquo;Landing Place of the Thunderbird\u0026rdquo; (Reimer 2018, SLCC 2016, Khelsilem 2015).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s common for snow capped mountains/glaciers to be named in place of the whole mountain. This can be seen in the words for snow covered mountain in both Lushootseed təqʷuʔmaʔ / təqʷuʔbəd (spuyaləpabš) and Yakama, pátu (Rude 2014). This misunderstanding of Native ontologies around mountains carried over, keeping the actual name for the Olympic Mountains buried to this day.\nDespite the best intentions to understand and record the names of the mountains in the area, there were many misunderstandings and omissions. There was also quite a lot left to be desired from the fidelity of recorded words. Perhaps this is to be expected of an era of settlers all trying to tell the biggest stories and show off the most knowledge, no matter how wrong or misunderstood it was.\nAdditionally, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until 1880 that John Wesley Powell started using a better fitting set of phonetic symbols. Eventually, Franz Boas used a variation of that character set. It was further expended upon by the American Anthropological Society in 1916 and became the Americanist phonetic notation. Simultaneously, around 1890 the International Phonetic Alphabet came into existence. However, only people with linguistic training would have used either of these. Consequently, only trained linguists around the 1900s would likely create higher fidelity written representations with audio recordings being the best source.\nThe above compilation of words from the people who have inhabited this region since time immemorial should show that it is still preferable to go directly to the source instead of relying on innacurate and careless transciptions of the Native tongues of this land in a foreign language. Despite some of these cultures loosing their elders who spoke the language, their language lives on in recordings and much of the modern work done to restore their languages from the brink of extinction. The collective knowledge of the tribe and recordings of the elders should still be held in high regard and should be open for their respective tribal citizens to hear and learn.\nAcknowledgments\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to thank Skyler Reed Corbett-Hecocta for setting me out on this path. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for them asking me about the name in case that I actually knew and could point them in the right direction for their metadata project, I\u0026rsquo;d likely never have dug into this as much as I did. I\u0026rsquo;d also like to thank them for finding the Klallam Word of the Day Facebook page.\nWorks Cited\nCostello, J. A. (1895). The Siwash: Their Life, Legends and Tales : Puget Sound and Pacific Northwest : Fully Illustrated. United States: Calvert Company.\nFrachtenberg, L.

Again, come join me. Gather round, let us listen. If it helps, you can go through the stretches in the previous blog post. This is going to be the first in a series of articles that might stretch some of you beyond your comfort zone. If you happen to be a person of color, this is likely to bring up trauma. You can step aside if you want to, or you can nod you head to the truths in here which make up daily life for many people. If you\u0026rsquo;re ready (this will take about an hour), let us begin.\nMexican Chef #    It\u0026rsquo;s a party across America // Bachata in the back  This forms the bridge which alludes back to all the other verses with its mentions of \u0026ldquo;Bachata in the back\u0026rdquo;. It forms a structure which mirrors the structural opression of Brown and Black bodies where we are generally kept out of the party (the metaphor for the ability to succeed and enjoy our lives). While this racial power dynamic may not be evenly spread across America, it does tend to be widespread in places where there is a mixed population and more affluent European decendents want cheap labor.\nIn places where there are only people of European descent, the emergent dynamic is that poor are disenfranchised compared to the more affluent peers. Additionally, they have been taught to have pride in the work they do and to not aspire to much beyond being the best worker they can. This makes them susceptible to racist scapegoating. It also keeps them hopeful, since they want to think that given enough hard work they can become as affluent as their peers and live the American dream many of their immigrant ancestors were tempted with. The problem is that there are very specific structural conditions which keep poor people from becoming affluent, no matter their race. Lack of access to capital is one of those structural conditions. However, only people who are not perceived as white suffer from racism. As Rom, Quarks brother, in DS9\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Bar Association\u0026rdquo; said:\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t understand. Ferengi wokers don\u0026rsquo;t want to stop the exploitation, we want to find a way to become the exploiters.\u0026rdquo;  This is perfectly representative of the average US capitalist mindset.\nThis Is America #    There\u0026rsquo;s too much to unpack about this song: wanting to party, but not being able to because it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;guerilla warfare\u0026rdquo;; wanting to make money, but racism and systemic injustice making it nearly impossible to do that; etc. To me, the most important lyrics are actually those at the very end of the song (it\u0026rsquo;s easy to miss them):\nYou just a black man in this world // You just a barcode, ayy  You just a black man in this world // Drivin' expensive foreigns, ayy  You just a big dawg, yeah // I kenneled him in the backyard  No proper life to a dog // For a big dog  I\u0026rsquo;m not going to unpack everything here, because a book could be written on the 13th Ammendment. Speaking of which, you should watch Ava Duvernays documentary. But if you\u0026rsquo;re already hip to that, let\u0026rsquo;s go on:\nFrom the begning of America as the United States, and even before, there was a strong component of white supremacy and slavery. This means that where there was slavery, where there was racism, or where white supremacy took hold, there is still a cultural component of that present in modern populations. No matter how enlighted one person of European descent is, there is likely another person (or two!) who feels equally empowered by white supremacy.\n\u0026ldquo;The Nixon campiagn in 1968, and the Nixon White House ater that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I\u0026rsquo;m saying? We knew we could make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and the criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and villify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u0026quot; — John Ehrlichman, Nixon Advisor  This quote hopefully gives you the proper picture that there are people who are white supremacists with wealth who want to shape society in America. They have seen the opening to promulgate white supremacy and raism through the 13th ammendment ever since the US forced some of the southern states to ratify it at gunpoint. Quitely, through the generations, they have been passing on their beliefs and culture of white supremacy to their children and those who will listen to them. These people do not consider these weird, backward, or foreign beliefs, because it\u0026rsquo;s what they live.\nBecause of these contemptible people, life for Black people in America is equivalent to being treated like a runaway dog that needs to be kenneled in America\u0026rsquo;s back yard: prison. Because of these contemptible, backwards people, life in America is like not having a name. It like being a product, a machine that can sew clothes, debur fishing weights, fight you fires for free, etc. Need I go on?\nReality Check (feat. Akenya \u0026amp; Eryn Allen Kane) #    This is song about the self-doubt that racism creates and pushing past it.\nLAND OF THE FREE #    We can\u0026rsquo;t change the world \u0026lsquo;less we change ourselves. \u0026hellip; In the land of the free, is for the free loaders // Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors  Meditate (feat. J.I.D.) #    Looking for peace in America Looking for peace when I stare at you  Stay Alive #    But me I\u0026rsquo;m just tryna keep my head above water, man And if they take it all away Our freedom and our hearts and that glow in your face I\u0026rsquo;ll remind you who were before it changed (I\u0026rsquo;ll remind you who were) All of these traps, and all of these street signs None of them will be yours or mine But I\u0026rsquo;ll be your empire (Your empire) Just stay alive, stay alive, stay alive But me I\u0026rsquo;m just tryna keep my head above waters, man  Unmoved (A Black Woman Truth) #    When you listen to this song, I want you to listen for some lines tucked away in the center of the song:\nYou get a new leader and think you know trauma (ooh-ooh-ooh-oh) I\u0026rsquo;m 20 years of breakdowns and mantras (hmm, hmm) So, spare me the shock in looking at yourselves  The big important truth about this is that while you might just be waking up to this, it\u0026rsquo;s been going on for a lot longer than you\u0026rsquo;ve been aware of.\nI Can\u0026rsquo;t Breathe #    The lyrics say it all.\nCasket Pretty #    Ditto.\nPray For Me (with Kendrick Lamar) #    While this song was originally from Black Panther, it fits in with the basic theme.\nOtun #    This is a song about the Palenquero funerary ritual written in Spanish. I have a hunch the non-Spanish parts mean something in one of the many African languages which came across with their once enslaved ancestors.\nThe Spanish parts basically say (I made no attempt to make it fit in the meter.): Praise Mary, who conceived without sinning. Here we call out your praise — in the Palenque Lumbalú (funerary ritual) Let us go with songs and prayers, today preparing the altar for one departing to eternity. Praise Mary who appears if you evoke her. With fervor we prepare the opening to the portal. We\u0026rsquo;ve said our goodbyes. The candles are going to go out. Prepare the way for the departing soul. Here we call out your praise — in the Palenque Lumbalú for the departing soul.  How I Feel #    I\u0026rsquo;m a few degrees away and a thousand times defeated My energy is depleted But I wanna stand and fight So we can move the spirit instead travel back into the light I feel the fears and depression Fears and aggression Woven into society from years of oppression The violence is normalized Silence is horrifying Truth is denied and the fact is that more are dying You don\u0026rsquo;t have to tell me how you feel \u0026lsquo;Cause I can hear it in their cries \u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a nation with racism here since the start of it Hard to let go cause it\u0026rsquo;s carved in the heart of it Relation to the land and our rise were a part of it Roots where I stand, I could never depart from it And you don\u0026rsquo;t have to tell me how you feel \u0026lsquo;Cause I can see it in your eyes And they don\u0026rsquo;t have to prove to me that the pain is real \u0026lsquo;Cause I can hear it in their cries  Fuego De Cumbia (Cumbia Fire) #    This is my translation of this décima. I tried my best to keep it in the right meter so it can be sung in place of the Spanish.\nA pure-blood fire of sad song.  Our pitch black nights are unfolded with singing and our revelry, The rhythmic refrain of the drums are sent skyward by the Black race. The old Indian stands there playing his melodic wooden flutes. They push aside any silence during our dance and our bonfire— A fire that does not die out, is felt so deeply in my veins.\nchorus:  This the fire of my cumbia, this is the fire of my race— a pure-blood fire of sad song. A pure-blood fire of sad song.  In my homeland, undisturbed tombs are without tribes and without chiefs. A joy has stayed with the Black race ever since you saw all of us here. With strength and courage they are free, mixing themselves with the Indian. They sing the sadness of our land, like the fire of my cumbia, like the fire of my race, a pure-blood fire of sad song.\nchorus \nHere there are many ancient signs of our pre-Columbian times. Because to speak of wooden flutes is to travel backwards in time, to inhabit our yesterday and the science of the Indian. It is recalling older times of long gone centuries ago— but it leaves this modern mixture of culture and civility.\nchorus \n Fight Like Ida B \u0026amp; Marsha P #    If you don\u0026rsquo;t know about the people mentioned in this video, you really need to read up on them:\n Ida B. Wells-Barnet — She was an early leader in the civil rights movement, and investigative journalist, and an educator. There\u0026rsquo;s a article about how her and her great-granddaughter is still fighting for the same things over at Time. Marsha P. Johnson — Her, along with her friend, Silvia Riveria, were at the Stonewall uprising. They also cofounded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. These days, the T has been replaced with Transgender, becuase it\u0026rsquo;s a better match. Back when it was founded, the word \u0026ldquo;transgender\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Ella Baker — There\u0026rsquo;s a shout out to her in the begining of the song. She was a major force in organizing within the civil rights movement.  Lockdown #    You should\u0026rsquo;ve been downtown (down) The people are risin' (look around) We thought it was a lockdown (lockdown) They opened up fire (had to get low, fire) Them bullets was flyin' (down, down) Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (ooh-wee)  Lockdown, we ain\u0026rsquo;t gotta stop \u0026lsquo;cause they tell us to In downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet Tre pound (uh), got it in my name now, I\u0026rsquo;ma shoot it Lockdown, we ain\u0026rsquo;t gotta stop \u0026lsquo;cause they tell us to In downtown  El Feo #    This song features some lyrics in a Zapotec language. I can\u0026rsquo;t translate them (though I think I know someone who could), but here\u0026rsquo;s the translation of the Spanish. I made no attempt to make it fit in the meter.\nIf they talk of me — muchachita — if they talk of me in your presence, say I\u0026rsquo;m your Black Saint. I\u0026rsquo;m an ugly one — I\u0026rsquo;m an ugly one that knows how to love.  He truly loves you with all of his heart.  There\u0026rsquo;s a bit of context behind the \u0026ldquo;Black Saint\u0026rdquo;, San Baltazar, also Santo Cambá. According to stories, he was one the three Magi (kings, as most people call them) who visited Jesus on the Epiphany and gave the gift of Frankincense. This character went through several evolutions. At first, he was white. Then there was a Black child who attended to him as a page. Then he became Black and one of his compatriots became Asian. Christianity changed the depiction to give people a Black token in Christendom. This last change happened right around the start of slavery and as the slavers were converting enslaved Black people to slavery.\nEnslaved people freed themselves and formed their own communities. They made Baltazar their own saint — seemingly representative of the only Black person who was respected by Christians. Because of racism, everyone who didn\u0026rsquo;t conform to European or mestizo standards of beauty was considered ugly, or \u0026ldquo;un feo\u0026rdquo;. Part of me wonders how many people still hold thes views, since I\u0026rsquo;ve met a few people who do. People tend to call them \u0026ldquo;a product of their age\u0026rdquo; but seems to absolve them of their actions and they are still very responsible for the views they hold and the words they say.\nSee:\n Balthazar (Wikipedia) Bond, S.E., Junior, N.

This Bitter Land #    There are several ways this song pays homage to \u0026ldquo;Strange Fruit\u0026rdquo;. The lyrics themselves allude to the title.

Let your neck relax and return the center of your body so your head is bowed and stop in the center. Bring your head back to its normal position. Repeat for the left side. From an upright position, lean to the right and stretch. Return to center. Lean to the left and stretch. Return to center. Keep your back relatively straight and bend forward to feel a slight stretch in your lower back. Return to center.\nNow take some time to focus on your breath, let\u0026rsquo;s say 4 minutes, but longer if you have the time. Feel the sensations in your body while you focus on your breath. Watch your thoughts as they pass through your mind without holding onto them or following them. See the stream of reality pass by. Experience the ripples and eddies. Notice it all, but do not dwell upon any of it drifting past the riverbanks of your soul. Breathe in. Breathe out.\nVision #  Let us each build a world. Envision the society you think you\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted. Include as little or as much of our current world as you see fit. What institutions should make it into this envisioned world? What social structures and power dynamics should be in this new experience of the world? Of all the concepts in our world, what should be included and what should be left out?\nShould there be more ceremony? More art? More music? More vibrance? Less poverty? Does your vision draw upon ideas which could improve the lives of people in your life? Does it just improve your own life? What kind of people are here living together in harmony in this world? How did that unfold and how does it work? How do people resolve their differences in this world?\nAre there completely new institutions that should come to be? Take your time. Be creative. Stretch your limits if you can.\nDecenter #  Now I want to focus on the other people in your vision. Who did you include? Did you leave people out? I don\u0026rsquo;t want this be a judgemental experience. I want this to be a learning experience. Please go easy on yourself. Remember to observe but not dwell on. Observe, but not be taken over by it. You can always come back to it later and reevaluate yourself.\nWhile answering the next set of questions, focus on breathing and relaxing into this self knowledge. Once, I was walking around barefoot. I stepped on a group of rocks. My first reaction was to holler in pain. My second reaction was to relax into it. If my foot could relax, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be pushing as hard against the rocks and pebbles. This means it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt my nerves as much, because there would be less pressure. Relaxing into this self knowledge allows us to more fully understand it by sitting with it. It gives us the opportunity to explore without immediately running away.\nIn your vision:\n How many people were there who think differently than you? How many people were raised in a different culture? How many people were there who don\u0026rsquo;t look like you? How many ethnicities did your include in your vision? Did those ethnicities reflect the true variety of cultural and \u0026ldquo;racial\u0026rdquo; makeup of each one? (specifically regarding the history specific to those people due to a different culture or skin color) How many LGBTQQIAAP people did you include? How many of the LGBTQQIAAP people were BIPOC? How many of your friends did you include? How many friends of friends did you include? How many locations and countries did you include? How many institutions and cultures did you change?  Did you remove them because you saw them impacting the above people, or because it impacts you?   How many institutions / ceremonies / feasts / gatherings / traditions / cultures did you add?  Did you add them because you saw them impacting the above people, or because you just thought they were a good idea?   How many needs of all of these groups did you use to make you vision of a better world? How different was the group of people you imagined coming together at the begining of this post compared to the people you envisioned in the perfect world? How certain are you that the changes you made wouldn\u0026rsquo;t require other people to change vital aspects about their cultures?  Keep these things in mind: No one has a full grasp on all of these issues. In the so called \u0026ldquo;Americas\u0026rdquo; there are around at least 1500 Indigenous groups across all the landmass. There are over 5000 Indigenous groups/nations worldwide. There are currently 195 recognized countries in the world. Each of those countries has its own collection of ethnicities and groups with their own issues. I\u0026rsquo;m sure the issues vary by region, too. I would bet that even managing a list of all of your friends' issues is difficult these days.\nRefocus #  Now that we have a better concept of the limits of our own imaginations, we can work to expand them with a few tools. What is something we could focus on to reveal what would make things better for other people? Everyone has them, babies especially. Any guesses?\nNeeds.\nNo one knows the needs of everyone, but in our society so many people don\u0026rsquo;t have their needs met. This is probably why most visions people project out into the world fail. Most people in politics focus on the economy: how productive we are, how many jobs there are, the velocity of money. They have a hope that the market will meet the needs of the people because of a constant balancing of supply and demand. Unfortunately, many aspects of life can get in the way of people meeting their own needs.\nAccording to a story about cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, the first sign of a civilization is the ability to take care of someone who is dealing with a potentially life threatening injury until they can recover. I really like that picture. Imagine a society where everyone worked together to meet their collective needs. Our society shows signs of being an anti-civilization. We get so focused on meeting our own needs through the market that we have no time or no spare resources to help other people — or even listen to them unless it is to participate in the market itself.\nWhat many people fail to see about a progression to a corporate and capitalist economy is corporations with capital become drivers of the economty and the needs of the people no longer drive the economy. The jobs follow the capital. Many people say the capital is a direct result of the people and their desires, but much capital is under the control of management and investment firms out of the reach of most people. These cannot fully operate in the realm of needs. Food doesn\u0026rsquo;t make money unless you can minimize cost. Rent doesn\u0026rsquo;t yield much return for the investment unless they are \u0026ldquo;luxury\u0026rdquo; apartments or condos. If growing food and property management cannot yield much gain, why should they really be commodities? Some people have argued they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be commodities.\nWe need to come back the basics of meeting people\u0026rsquo;s needs. The only way to know what someone\u0026rsquo;s or some groups needs are is to ask them. Listen carefully when they tell you their needs. Work hard to arrive at a neutral root cause. Who is asking what people\u0026rsquo;s needs are? You could be asking these questions if no one else around you is. Maybe more people will start asking, \u0026ldquo;How can I help you meet your needs today?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;What are your needs?\u0026rdquo;\nCurrently, I see people using people\u0026rsquo;s needs as weapons. It\u0026rsquo;s true, weak spots can be leveraged to turn people against each other: \u0026ldquo;You need a job? Oh that person over there is coming to steal the job you were going to get.\u0026rdquo; People can accept this without critically dissecting why they would loose the job. It\u0026rsquo;s not because that other person is coming over here, it because people with capital can exploit that to lower wages. This is what the anti-leaders occupying leadership positions around the globe today are saying and how they are creating more division. True leadership focuses on meeting the needs of the people who are part of their group. If people\u0026rsquo;s needs are taken care of, they can focus on what needs to be done.\nI leave you with a few questions:\n Are your needs being met? How aware are you of the people around you and their needs? Are the needs of the people around you being met? If your needs are met and the needs of the people around you are not met, are you content with not helping those around you? If you and everyone around has their needs met, are you all content with not helping people further away? If someone cannot meet their needs, who\u0026rsquo;s responsibility is it? Does individualism preclude all communal help? If neither you nor the people around you are getting your needs met, what are the strategies and tactics you are going to use to organize, be heard, and get your needs met? Between all of you, are there enough skills and ability to find a solution? When you meet a person\u0026rsquo;s needs, how sensitive are you to their history, individuality, and intersection with numerous cultures? How much does that kind of sensitivity matter? How much of that sensitivity is too much? How hard are you working to establish a relationship, and not just a one time gift?  This might be a lot to examine all at once, so take your time and process it and think about it over the rest of the year (or longer, if need be). Try and figure out if there are any attitudes you have which could change. Try to figure out if there are any actions you could take and try to integrate those actions into your daily life.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/writing/2020-05-19-star-trek-or-us-space-force/','title':"Star Trek or US Space Force?",'content':""});index.add({'id':13,'href':'/writing/2020-04-10-coronavirus-sars-cov2-dissecting-the-virus/','title':"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Dissecting the virus",'content':""});index.add({'id':14,'href':'/writing/2020-03-17-coronavirus-sars-cov2/','title':"Coronavirus SARS-CoV2: 03/17/2020",'content':""});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/writing/2020-02-10-our-broken-realities/','title':"Our Broken Realities",'content':""});index.add({'id':16,'href':'/writing/2019-11-14-a-history-of-amazon-deforestation/','title':"A History of Amazon Deforestation",'content':""});index.add({'id':17,'href':'/writing/2019-07-21-root-beers-indigneous-roots/','title':"Root Beer’s Indigenous Roots",'content':""});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/writing/2019-07-31-the-origin-of-concentration-camps/','title':"The Origin of Concentration Camps",'content':""});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/writing/2019-03-05-help-im-being-stalked-by-robots/','title':"Help!
